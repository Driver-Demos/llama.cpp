# Purpose
The provided C++ source code file is a forward declaration header for the "JSON for Modern C++" library, authored by Niels Lohmann. This file, `json_fwd.hpp`, is designed to provide forward declarations for key components of the library, such as `basic_json`, `json_pointer`, and `ordered_map`. These forward declarations allow other parts of a program to reference these types without including the full definitions, which can help reduce compilation times and dependencies. The file also defines several macros related to the library's versioning and namespace management, ensuring compatibility and proper linkage across different versions of the library.

The file includes essential C++ standard library headers like `<cstdint>`, `<map>`, `<memory>`, `<string>`, and `<vector>`, which are necessary for the type definitions used in the forward declarations. It establishes a namespace structure using macros to handle ABI (Application Binary Interface) tags and versioning, which is crucial for maintaining binary compatibility across different builds of the library. The file does not define any public APIs directly but sets up the necessary groundwork for the library's components to be used elsewhere in a program. This header is a critical part of the library's infrastructure, ensuring that users can efficiently integrate JSON handling capabilities into their C++ applications.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `cstdint`
- `map`
- `memory`
- `string`
- `vector`


# Global Variables

---
### ArrayType
- **Type**: `template<typename U, typename... Args> class`
- **Description**: `ArrayType` is a template parameter for the `basic_json` class, which defaults to `std::vector`. It represents the type used to store JSON array values within the `basic_json` class.
- **Use**: `ArrayType` is used as a template parameter to define the container type for JSON arrays in the `basic_json` class.


---
### StringType
- **Type**: `class`
- **Description**: `StringType` is a template parameter for the `basic_json` class, which defaults to `std::string`. It represents the type used for string values within the JSON data structure.
- **Use**: `StringType` is used to define the type of strings stored in JSON objects when using the `basic_json` class.


---
### BooleanType
- **Type**: `class`
- **Description**: `BooleanType` is a template parameter in the `basic_json` class template, which is used to define the type for boolean values within a JSON object. By default, it is set to the built-in C++ type `bool`, allowing JSON boolean values to be represented as true or false.
- **Use**: `BooleanType` is used as a template parameter to specify the type for boolean values in the `basic_json` class, allowing customization of the boolean type if needed.


---
### NumberIntegerType
- **Type**: `class`
- **Description**: `NumberIntegerType` is a template parameter in the `basic_json` class, which is defined as `std::int64_t`. It represents the type used for storing integer numbers in JSON objects.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define the type of integer numbers within the `basic_json` class, allowing for consistent handling of integer values in JSON data.


---
### NumberUnsignedType
- **Type**: `std::uint64_t`
- **Description**: `NumberUnsignedType` is a type alias for `std::uint64_t`, which represents an unsigned 64-bit integer. It is used as a template parameter in the `basic_json` class to define the type for unsigned integer values in JSON data.
- **Use**: This variable is used to specify the type for unsigned integer values when working with JSON data in the `basic_json` class.


---
### NumberFloatType
- **Type**: `double`
- **Description**: `NumberFloatType` is a type alias for the `double` data type, used within the `basic_json` template class to represent floating-point numbers in JSON data.
- **Use**: It is used as the default type for floating-point numbers in JSON objects managed by the `basic_json` class.


---
### CustomBaseClass
- **Type**: `class`
- **Description**: `CustomBaseClass` is a template parameter for the `basic_json` class, which defaults to `void`. It allows users to specify a custom base class for the `basic_json` class, providing flexibility to extend or modify the behavior of JSON objects.
- **Use**: `CustomBaseClass` is used as a template parameter in the `basic_json` class to allow for customization by specifying a different base class.
