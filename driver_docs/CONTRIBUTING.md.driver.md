# Purpose
This file is a comprehensive contribution and coding guideline document for the `llama.cpp` project, which utilizes the `ggml` tensor library for model evaluation. It serves as a guide for contributors and collaborators, detailing the procedures for submitting pull requests, coding standards, naming conventions, and documentation practices. The document is structured into several sections, each focusing on specific aspects such as pull request protocols, coding guidelines, naming conventions, and documentation efforts. The guidelines emphasize maintaining code quality, consistency, and readability, while also ensuring compatibility across different systems. This file is crucial for maintaining a coherent and efficient development process within the codebase, ensuring that all contributors adhere to the same standards and practices.
# Content Summary
This document provides comprehensive guidelines and instructions for contributors and collaborators working on the `llama.cpp` project, which utilizes the `ggml` tensor library for model evaluation. It is structured into several sections, each addressing different aspects of contribution and coding standards.

### Pull Requests for Contributors
Contributors are advised to familiarize themselves with the `ggml` library through provided examples. Before submitting a pull request (PR), contributors should test their changes locally, ensuring that performance and perplexity are not adversely affected. If modifications are made to the `ggml` source, consistency across different backends must be verified. Contributors are encouraged to create separate PRs for distinct features or fixes and to allow write access to their branches for expedited reviews.

### Pull Requests for Collaborators
Collaborators are instructed to squash-merge PRs and follow a specific format for commit titles, which includes the module name and issue number. They are also encouraged to add themselves to the `CODEOWNERS` file for better project management.

### Coding Guidelines
The coding guidelines emphasize simplicity and cross-compatibility, discouraging the use of complex STL constructs and third-party dependencies. Code should be clean, with specific formatting rules such as using 4 spaces for indentation and placing brackets on the same line. The document specifies the use of sized integer types and provides instructions for struct declarations. It also highlights the unconventional nature of matrix multiplication in the project and advises using `clang-format` for code consistency.

### Naming Guidelines
Naming conventions are detailed, advocating for `snake_case` for functions, variables, and types, with enum values in uppercase prefixed by the enum name. The document outlines a general naming pattern for methods and classes, and specifies the use of the `_t` suffix for opaque types. File naming conventions for C/C++ and Python are also provided.

### Preprocessor Directives and Documentation
While guidelines for preprocessor directives are yet to be detailed, the document stresses the importance of community-driven documentation. Contributors are encouraged to update documentation when they encounter outdated or incorrect information.

### Resources
The document concludes by directing contributors to GitHub issues, PRs, and discussions for additional information and context about the codebase, with a link to relevant GitHub projects.

Overall, this document serves as a crucial resource for maintaining code quality and consistency within the `llama.cpp` project, ensuring that all contributors and collaborators adhere to established standards and practices.
