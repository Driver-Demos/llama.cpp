## Files
- **[arithmetic.gbnf](grammars/arithmetic.gbnf.driver.md)**: The `arithmetic.gbnf` file defines a grammar for parsing arithmetic expressions, including support for variables, numbers, and basic arithmetic operations.
- **[c.gbnf](grammars/c.gbnf.driver.md)**: The `c.gbnf` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase defines a grammar for parsing a subset of C-like language constructs, including declarations, statements, expressions, and comments.
- **[chess.gbnf](grammars/chess.gbnf.driver.md)**: The `chess.gbnf` file defines a grammar for specifying chess moves in algebraic notation following PGN conventions, including rules for move sequences, piece movements, and castling.
- **[english.gbnf](grammars/english.gbnf.driver.md)**: The `english.gbnf` file defines a grammar for parsing English text, specifying rules for characters including letters, digits, and punctuation.
- **[japanese.gbnf](grammars/japanese.gbnf.driver.md)**: The `japanese.gbnf` file defines a grammar for Japanese text using character classes such as hiragana, katakana, punctuation, and CJK characters.
- **[json.gbnf](grammars/json.gbnf.driver.md)**: The `json.gbnf` file defines a grammar for parsing JSON data, specifying the structure and rules for objects, arrays, strings, numbers, and whitespace.
- **[json_arr.gbnf](grammars/json_arr.gbnf.driver.md)**: The `json_arr.gbnf` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase defines a grammar for JSON arrays with restricted whitespace at the end of the root array, useful for generating JSON arrays.
- **[list.gbnf](grammars/list.gbnf.driver.md)**: The `list.gbnf` file defines a grammar for parsing lists where each item starts with a hyphen and excludes certain line break characters.
- **[README.md](grammars/README.md.driver.md)**: The `README.md` file in the `llama.cpp/grammars` directory provides a comprehensive guide to using GBNF (GGML BNF) for defining formal grammars to constrain model outputs in `llama.cpp`, including examples, syntax rules, and integration with JSON schemas.
