# Purpose
This file is a `.gitignore` configuration file used in a Git repository to specify intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. It includes patterns to ignore compiled object files (`*.o`), archive files (`*.a`), cache directories (`.cache/`), and various development environment directories and files such as `.vs/`, `.vscode/`, and `.DS_Store`. It also excludes specific build directories, model files, and certain executables and configuration files from being tracked by Git.
