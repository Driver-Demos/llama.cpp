# Purpose
This C++ header file provides a narrow functionality focused on managing the lifecycle of specific objects related to the "llama" library, as indicated by the inclusion of "llama.h". It defines custom deleters for four types of objects: `llama_model`, `llama_context`, `llama_sampler`, and `llama_adapter_lora`, ensuring that the appropriate free functions are called when these objects are no longer needed. By using `std::unique_ptr` with these custom deleters, the code facilitates automatic and safe memory management, preventing memory leaks. The use of `#pragma once` and a preprocessor check ensures that this header is only included once per compilation and is used exclusively in C++ projects.

# Data Structures

---
### llama\_model\_deleter<!-- {{#data_structure:llama_model_deleter}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Description**: The `llama_model_deleter` is a custom deleter struct designed to manage the lifecycle of `llama_model` objects. It defines an overloaded function call operator that takes a pointer to a `llama_model` and calls `llama_model_free` on it, ensuring that the resources associated with the `llama_model` are properly released when the object is no longer needed. This struct is typically used in conjunction with smart pointers, such as `std::unique_ptr`, to automate memory management and prevent memory leaks.
- **Member Functions**:
    - [`llama_model_deleter::operator()`](#llama_model_deleteroperator())

**Methods**

---
#### llama\_model\_deleter::operator\(\)<!-- {{#callable:llama_model_deleter::operator()}} -->
The `operator()` function in the `llama_model_deleter` struct is a custom deleter that frees a `llama_model` object using the `llama_model_free` function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `model`: A pointer to a `llama_model` object that needs to be freed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes a pointer to a `llama_model` as its argument.
    - It calls the `llama_model_free` function, passing the `model` pointer to it, which handles the deallocation of the `llama_model` object.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs a side effect by freeing the memory associated with the `llama_model` object.

### llama\_context\_deleter<!-- {{#data_structure:llama_context_deleter}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Description**: The `llama_context_deleter` is a custom deleter struct designed to manage the lifecycle of `llama_context` objects. It defines an overloaded function call operator that takes a pointer to a `llama_context` and calls the `llama_free` function to properly release the resources associated with the context. This struct is typically used in conjunction with smart pointers, such as `std::unique_ptr`, to ensure automatic and safe memory management of `llama_context` instances.
- **Member Functions**:
    - [`llama_context_deleter::operator()`](#llama_context_deleteroperator())

**Methods**

---
#### llama\_context\_deleter::operator\(\)<!-- {{#callable:llama_context_deleter::operator()}} -->
The `operator()` function in the `llama_context_deleter` struct is a custom deleter that frees a `llama_context` object using the `llama_free` function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `context`: A pointer to a `llama_context` object that needs to be freed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes a `llama_context` pointer as an argument.
    - It calls the `llama_free` function with the provided `context` pointer to release the associated resources.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs a cleanup operation on the `llama_context` object.
- **See also**: [`llama_context_deleter`](#llama_context_deleter)  (Data Structure)



---
### llama\_sampler\_deleter<!-- {{#data_structure:llama_sampler_deleter}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Description**: The `llama_sampler_deleter` is a custom deleter struct designed to be used with smart pointers, specifically `std::unique_ptr`, to manage the lifecycle of `llama_sampler` objects. It defines an overloaded function call operator that takes a pointer to a `llama_sampler` and calls `llama_sampler_free` to properly release the resources associated with the sampler. This ensures that when a `std::unique_ptr` with a `llama_sampler_deleter` goes out of scope, the associated `llama_sampler` is automatically and safely deallocated.
- **Member Functions**:
    - [`llama_sampler_deleter::operator()`](#llama_sampler_deleteroperator())

**Methods**

---
#### llama\_sampler\_deleter::operator\(\)<!-- {{#callable:llama_sampler_deleter::operator()}} -->
The `operator()` function in the `llama_sampler_deleter` struct is a custom deleter that frees a `llama_sampler` object.
- **Inputs**:
    - `sampler`: A pointer to a `llama_sampler` object that needs to be freed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes a `llama_sampler` pointer as an argument.
    - It calls the `llama_sampler_free` function with the provided `sampler` pointer to release the associated resources.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs a cleanup operation on the `llama_sampler` object.
- **See also**: [`llama_sampler_deleter`](#llama_sampler_deleter)  (Data Structure)

### llama\_adapter\_lora\_deleter<!-- {{#data_structure:llama_adapter_lora_deleter}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Description**: The `llama_adapter_lora_deleter` is a custom deleter struct designed to manage the lifecycle of `llama_adapter_lora` objects. It defines an overloaded function call operator that takes a pointer to a `llama_adapter_lora` and calls `llama_adapter_lora_free` to properly release the resources associated with the object. This struct is typically used in conjunction with smart pointers, such as `std::unique_ptr`, to ensure automatic and safe memory management of `llama_adapter_lora` instances.
- **Member Functions**:
    - [`llama_adapter_lora_deleter::operator()`](#llama_adapter_lora_deleteroperator())

**Methods**

---
#### llama\_adapter\_lora\_deleter::operator\(\)<!-- {{#callable:llama_adapter_lora_deleter::operator()}} -->
The `operator()` function in the `llama_adapter_lora_deleter` struct is a custom deleter that frees a `llama_adapter_lora` object using the `llama_adapter_lora_free` function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `adapter`: A pointer to a `llama_adapter_lora` object that needs to be freed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes a pointer to a `llama_adapter_lora` object as an argument.
    - It calls the `llama_adapter_lora_free` function, passing the `adapter` pointer to it, which handles the deallocation of the `llama_adapter_lora` object.
