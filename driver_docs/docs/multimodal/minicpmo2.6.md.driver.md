# Purpose
The provided content is a README file that serves as a guide for setting up and using the MiniCPM-o 2.6 model, specifically focusing on its image processing capabilities. It instructs users to download the MiniCPM-o 2.6 PyTorch model from Hugging Face and provides steps to build the `llama.cpp` project using CMake. The document details the conversion of the PyTorch model to gguf files, offering an alternative to download pre-converted files. It also includes commands for quantizing the model and running inference on Linux or Mac, with options for both single-turn and conversation modes. This README is essential for users to correctly configure and utilize the MiniCPM-o 2.6 model for image-related tasks.
