# Purpose
The provided content is a documentation snippet for setting up and running a software tool called "Gemma 3 vision," which is an experimental project intended for demonstration purposes. The document guides users on how to quickly start using pre-quantized models available from the ggml-org's Hugging Face account, detailing the build process using CMake and an alternative installation method via Homebrew for MacOS. It explains how to convert models using a script (`convert_hf_to_gguf.py`) to generate a necessary file (`mmproj.gguf`) for running the tool. Additionally, it outlines the requirements and steps to execute the tool, which involves using a text model, the generated mmproj file, and an image file to perform the intended operations.
