# Purpose
The provided content is a section of documentation for setting up and using the MiniCPM-V 2.6 model, which is a PyTorch-based model available on Hugging Face. The document guides users through the process of downloading the model, building the `llama.cpp` project using CMake, and converting the PyTorch model to gguf files for further use. It includes instructions for quantizing the model to an int4 version and provides command-line examples for running inference on Linux or Mac systems in both single-turn and conversation modes. The document serves as a comprehensive guide for users to prepare, build, and execute the model effectively, ensuring they can leverage its capabilities for image processing and other tasks.
