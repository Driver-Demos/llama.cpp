# Purpose
The provided content is a section of documentation for setting up and using the MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 model, which is a machine learning model available on Hugging Face. It guides users through downloading the PyTorch model, building the llama.cpp project using CMake, and converting the model to gguf files for further processing. The document includes instructions for quantizing the model to an int4 version and provides command-line examples for running inference in both single-turn and conversation modes on Linux or Mac systems. This setup allows users to leverage the model for tasks such as image analysis and interactive dialogue, ensuring they have the necessary tools and steps to effectively deploy the model in their environment.
