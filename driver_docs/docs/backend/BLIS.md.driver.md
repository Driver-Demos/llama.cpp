# Purpose
The provided content is an installation manual for BLIS, a software framework designed for high-performance dense linear algebra operations, similar to the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS). The document outlines the steps necessary to compile and install BLIS, emphasizing the use of OpenMP for easier core modification. It also includes instructions for compiling and executing a related project, llama.cpp, with specific CMake configurations to enable BLAS support. Additionally, the manual addresses a potential issue with Intel's `libimf.so` library, directing users to a Stack Overflow page for resolution. The document serves as a comprehensive guide for setting up and optimizing BLIS and related software on a system.
