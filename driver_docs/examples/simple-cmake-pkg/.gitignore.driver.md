# Purpose
This file is a `.gitignore` configuration file used in a Git repository to specify intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. It lists patterns for various types of build artifacts and temporary files, such as compiled object files, dynamic and static libraries, executables, logs, and directories related to build and environment configurations, ensuring these files are not included in version control.
