# Purpose
The provided content is a documentation excerpt for building and running a CMake-based example program called "simple-cmake-pkg" that utilizes the `llama.cpp` library. This document guides users on how to build the `llama.cpp` library and subsequently use it in an external project by leveraging CMake's `find_package()` command. It emphasizes the importance of building `llama.cpp` outside of the source tree and provides step-by-step instructions for cloning the repository, building, and installing the library. Additionally, it outlines the process for building the "simple-cmake-pkg" example and running it with a specified model, highlighting the automatic detection of hardware acceleration libraries during the build process.
