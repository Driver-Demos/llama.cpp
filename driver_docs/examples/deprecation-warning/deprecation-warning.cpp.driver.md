# Purpose
This C++ source code file is designed to serve as a deprecation warning mechanism for users running a specific binary. The primary functionality of the code is to inform users that the binary they are attempting to execute is deprecated and to guide them towards using a new, updated binary name. The code achieves this by extracting the program name from the command-line arguments, determining the appropriate replacement name by prefixing "llama-" to the original filename, and then printing a warning message to the standard output. If the original filename is "main", the replacement filename is explicitly set to "llama-cli". The warning message also includes a URL directing users to further information about the deprecation.

The code is structured as a standalone executable, as indicated by the presence of the [`main`](#main) function, which is the entry point for C++ programs. It does not define any public APIs or external interfaces, as its sole purpose is to execute and display a warning message. The code utilizes standard C++ libraries such as `<cstdio>` for output and `<string>` for string manipulation, and it employs an `unordered_map` header, although the latter is not used in the current implementation. The file is focused on a narrow functionality, specifically handling the deprecation warning for binaries, and it is likely intended to be used as a transitional tool during a software update or migration process.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `cstdio`
- `string`
- `unordered_map`


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function warns users that the current binary is deprecated and suggests an alternative filename to use.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of C-style strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `filename` to "main" and update it to the first command-line argument if available.
    - Extract the program name from the full path by finding the last occurrence of '/' or '\' and taking the substring after it.
    - Create a `replacement_filename` by prefixing "llama-" to the extracted program name.
    - Check if the program name is "main" and set `replacement_filename` to "llama-cli" if true.
    - Print a deprecation warning message to the standard output, suggesting the use of the `replacement_filename`.
    - Return `EXIT_FAILURE` to indicate the program should not continue.
- **Output**: The function returns `EXIT_FAILURE`, indicating the program should terminate with a failure status.
