## Files
- **[CMakeLists.txt](embedding/CMakeLists.txt.driver.md)**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file in `llama.cpp/examples/embedding` configures the build process for the `llama-embedding` executable, specifying source files, installation, library dependencies, and C++ standard requirements.
- **[embedding.cpp](embedding/embedding.cpp.driver.md)**: The `embedding.cpp` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase provides an implementation for generating and processing embeddings from input prompts using the LLaMA model, including tokenization, batch processing, and output formatting.
- **[README.md](embedding/README.md.driver.md)**: The `README.md` file in `llama.cpp/examples/embedding` provides instructions and examples for generating high-dimensional embedding vectors from text using the `llama.cpp` tool, including command-line options for customization.
