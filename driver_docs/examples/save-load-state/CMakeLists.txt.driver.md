# Purpose
This CMake configuration file defines the build instructions for an executable named `llama-save-load-state`. It specifies the source file `save-load-state.cpp`, sets the installation rules for the runtime, links the executable with the `common`, `llama`, and thread libraries, and enforces the use of C++17 standard features during compilation.
