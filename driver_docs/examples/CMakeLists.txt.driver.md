# Purpose
The provided content is a CMake configuration file used to manage the build process of a software project. It specifies dependencies, such as requiring the Threads package, and sets up compile flags through a custom function `llama_add_compile_flags()`. The file organizes the inclusion of various subdirectories, each likely containing different components or examples of the project, such as `batched`, `embedding`, and `training`. Conditional logic is used to handle different build environments, such as excluding certain directories when building with Emscripten, and managing backend-specific configurations, like `GGML_BACKEND_DL` and `GGML_SYCL`. This setup allows for modular and flexible compilation of the project's components, adapting to different platforms and configurations.
