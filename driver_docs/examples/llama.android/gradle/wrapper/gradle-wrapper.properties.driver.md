# Purpose
This file is a Gradle Wrapper configuration file, typically named `gradle-wrapper.properties`. It specifies the settings for downloading and storing the Gradle distribution, including the base directory for the distribution (`GRADLE_USER_HOME`), the path where the distribution is stored (`wrapper/dists`), and the URL from which the specific Gradle version (8.2) is downloaded.
