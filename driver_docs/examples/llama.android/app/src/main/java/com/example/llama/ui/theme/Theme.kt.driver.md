# Purpose
This Kotlin file is part of an Android application and is responsible for defining the UI theme, specifically using Jetpack Compose, a modern toolkit for building native Android UI. It provides a narrow functionality focused on theming by defining both dark and light color schemes and dynamically adjusting these based on the system's theme settings and Android version. The file includes a composable function, `LlamaAndroidTheme`, which applies the appropriate color scheme to the app's UI components, allowing for dynamic theming on devices running Android 12 or higher. Additionally, it manages the status bar color and appearance based on the selected theme, ensuring a cohesive look and feel across the application. This file is intended to be used as a library component within the app, providing a consistent theming structure that can be easily applied to various UI elements.

# Functions

---
### LlamaAndroidTheme
The `LlamaAndroidTheme` function applies a dynamic or static color scheme to a Compose UI based on the system's dark theme setting and Android version.
- **Inputs**:
    - `darkTheme`: A Boolean indicating whether the dark theme should be used, defaulting to the system's dark theme setting.
    - `dynamicColor`: A Boolean indicating whether dynamic colors should be used, defaulting to true, and applicable for Android 12+.
    - `content`: A composable lambda function representing the UI content to which the theme will be applied.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Determine the color scheme based on the `dynamicColor` flag and the Android version; use dynamic color schemes if supported and enabled, otherwise use predefined dark or light color schemes.
    - Retrieve the current view using `LocalView.current`.
    - If the view is not in edit mode, execute a `SideEffect` to set the status bar color and appearance based on the selected color scheme.
    - Apply the `MaterialTheme` with the determined color scheme, typography, and provided content.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it applies a theme to the provided composable content.
