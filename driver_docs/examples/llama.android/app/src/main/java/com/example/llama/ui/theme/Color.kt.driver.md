# Purpose
This code is part of a UI theme configuration for an Android application using Jetpack Compose, a modern toolkit for building native Android UI. It defines a set of color variables, each represented by a hexadecimal color value, which are likely used to maintain a consistent color scheme across the application's user interface. The file provides narrow functionality, focusing specifically on color definitions rather than broader application logic or behavior. It is not an executable file but rather a configuration file intended to be imported and used elsewhere in the application to style UI components consistently.
