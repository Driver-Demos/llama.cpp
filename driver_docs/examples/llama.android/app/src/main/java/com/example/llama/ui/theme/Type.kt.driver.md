# Purpose
This code file is part of an Android application, specifically dealing with the UI theme configuration using Jetpack Compose, a modern toolkit for building native Android UIs. It defines a set of typography styles using the Material Design 3 guidelines, which are intended to be used throughout the application to ensure consistent text styling. The file provides a narrow functionality focused on typography customization, setting default styles such as `bodyLarge`, and includes commented-out sections for additional styles like `titleLarge` and `labelSmall`, which can be customized further. This file is not an executable but rather a configuration component that is likely imported and utilized by other parts of the application to maintain a cohesive visual design.
