# Purpose
The provided content is a CMake configuration file, specifically a `CMakeLists.txt`, used in an Android project to manage the build process of native C/C++ code. This file sets the minimum required version of CMake, declares the project name as "llama-android," and specifies the inclusion of a subdirectory for building the "llama" library. It defines a shared library named after the project, which is essential for integrating native code with Android applications. The file also outlines the linking of necessary libraries, including the "llama" library, common utilities, and Android-specific libraries, ensuring that the native components are correctly compiled and packaged with the Android application.
