# Purpose
This code is an Android instrumented test file, which is designed to run on an Android device or emulator to verify the application's behavior in a real-world environment. It provides narrow functionality, focusing specifically on testing the context of the application under test. The file imports necessary testing libraries and uses the JUnit framework to define a test class, `ExampleInstrumentedTest`, annotated with `@RunWith(AndroidJUnit4::class)`, indicating it uses the AndroidJUnit4 test runner. The `useAppContext` method is a test case that retrieves the application context and asserts that the package name is as expected, ensuring that the app is correctly set up in its testing environment. This file is part of a broader suite of tests aimed at validating the application's functionality and integration on Android platforms.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `androidx.test.platform.app.InstrumentationRegistry`
- `androidx.test.ext.junit.runners.AndroidJUnit4`
- `org.junit.Test`
- `org.junit.runner.RunWith`
- `org.junit.Assert.*`


# Functions

---
### useAppContext
The `useAppContext` function tests whether the app context's package name matches the expected package name.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the app context using `InstrumentationRegistry.getInstrumentation().targetContext`.
    - Assert that the package name of the app context is equal to 'android.llama.cpp.test'.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs an assertion to validate the app context's package name.
