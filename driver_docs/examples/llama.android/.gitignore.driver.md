# Purpose
This file is a `.gitignore` configuration for a software project, likely an Android application. It specifies files and directories that should be excluded from version control, including build artifacts, local configuration files, logs, IDE-specific files, keystore files, and profiling data. This ensures that only relevant source code and necessary files are tracked in the repository.
