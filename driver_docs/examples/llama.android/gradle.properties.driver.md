# Purpose
The provided file is a Gradle configuration file used to define project-wide settings for a software project, likely an Android application. It specifies JVM arguments for the Gradle daemon process, such as memory allocation and file encoding, to optimize build performance. The file also includes settings for enabling AndroidX, which helps differentiate between packages bundled with the Android OS and those included in the app's APK. Additionally, it sets the Kotlin code style to "official" and configures the use of non-transitive R classes to reduce the size of the R class by limiting it to resources declared within the library itself. These configurations are crucial for managing build performance, code style consistency, and resource management in the project.
