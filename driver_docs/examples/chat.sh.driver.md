# Purpose
This Bash script is a temporary utility designed to execute a specific command-line interface (CLI) operation using the `llama-cli` tool. It provides narrow functionality, primarily focused on running a pre-defined model (`llama-7b`) with specific parameters such as context size, batch size, and repetition penalty, while utilizing a prompt file (`prompts/chat-with-bob.txt`). The script changes the working directory to the parent directory of its location before executing the command, ensuring that the relative paths to the model and prompt file are correctly resolved. The script is not intended for long-term use, as indicated by the comment stating it will be removed in the future, suggesting it serves a temporary or experimental purpose.
