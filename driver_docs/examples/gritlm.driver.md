## Files
- **[CMakeLists.txt](gritlm/CMakeLists.txt.driver.md)**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file in `llama.cpp/examples/gritlm` configures the build process for the `llama-gritlm` executable, specifying its source file, installation, library dependencies, and C++ standard.
- **[gritlm.cpp](gritlm/gritlm.cpp.driver.md)**: The `gritlm.cpp` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase provides an example implementation of encoding sentences into embeddings and generating text using the GritLM model, including calculating cosine similarities between embeddings and generating text based on prompts.
- **[README.md](gritlm/README.md.driver.md)**: The `README.md` file in the `llama.cpp/examples/gritlm` directory provides an overview and instructions for using the Generative Representational Instruction Tuning (GRIT) model, including its application in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and steps to run an example with the Grit model.
