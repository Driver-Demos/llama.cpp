# Purpose
This CMake configuration file defines the build instructions for an executable named "llama-parallel" from the source file "parallel.cpp". It specifies that the executable should be linked with the "common", "llama", and thread libraries, and it requires C++17 standard features. The file also includes an installation rule for the runtime of the "llama-parallel" target.
