# Purpose
This CMake configuration file defines the build process for a C++ executable named "llama-speculative-simple" from the source file "speculative-simple.cpp". It specifies that the executable should be installed, links it with the libraries "common", "llama", and thread libraries, and enforces the use of C++17 standard features during compilation.
