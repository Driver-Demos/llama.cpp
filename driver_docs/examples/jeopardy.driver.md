## Files
- **[graph.py](jeopardy/graph.py.driver.md)**: The `graph.py` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase reads Jeopardy results from text files, calculates the number of correct answers, and generates a bar chart comparing the performance of different models.
- **[jeopardy.sh](jeopardy/jeopardy.sh.driver.md)**: The `jeopardy.sh` file is a Bash script that runs a Jeopardy game using a specified language model to answer questions from a text file, outputting the results to a designated file.
- **[qasheet.csv](jeopardy/qasheet.csv.driver.md)**: The `qasheet.csv` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase contains a collection of trivia questions and answers organized by category, with prompts designed for a model to generate responses.
- **[questions.txt](jeopardy/questions.txt.driver.md)**: The `questions.txt` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase contains a list of trivia questions covering a wide range of topics, including history, literature, geography, and pop culture.
- **[README.md](jeopardy/README.md.driver.md)**: The `README.md` file in the `llama.cpp/examples/jeopardy` directory provides instructions for setting up and running a Jeopardy test to compare the factual knowledge of different models, with an added feature for generating a graph of the results.
