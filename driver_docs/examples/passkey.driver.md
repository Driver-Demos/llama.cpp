## Files
- **[CMakeLists.txt](passkey/CMakeLists.txt.driver.md)**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file in `llama.cpp/examples/passkey` configures the build system to compile and install the `llama-passkey` executable, linking it with the `common`, `llama`, and threading libraries, and requiring C++17 features.
- **[passkey.cpp](passkey/passkey.cpp.driver.md)**: The `passkey.cpp` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase is an example program that initializes a language model to generate text with a hidden passkey within a large amount of irrelevant text, and then decodes the generated text to retrieve the passkey.
- **[README.md](passkey/README.md.driver.md)**: The `README.md` file in `llama.cpp/examples/passkey` provides an overview and usage instructions for a passkey retrieval task used to evaluate a language model's ability to recall information from long contexts.
