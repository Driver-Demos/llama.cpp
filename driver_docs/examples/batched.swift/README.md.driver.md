# Purpose
The file provides instructions for building and executing a Swift-based clone of the `examples/batched` program. It specifies using the `make` command to compile the program and provides a command-line usage example for running the compiled executable `llama-batched-swift` with arguments for `MODEL_PATH`, an optional `PROMPT`, and an optional `PARALLEL` parameter.
