# Purpose
The provided content is a Swift Package Manager manifest file, which is used to define a Swift package named "llama-batched-swift." This file specifies the minimum Swift version required to build the package, which is version 5.5, and it targets the macOS platform with a minimum version of 12. The package has a dependency on another package named "llama," which is located at a relative path. The manifest also defines an executable target named "llama-batched-swift," which depends on the "llama" package and includes source files located in the "Sources" directory. Additionally, the target is configured to link against the "Foundation" and "AppKit" frameworks, which are essential for macOS applications.
