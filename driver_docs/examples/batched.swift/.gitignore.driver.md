# Purpose
The file contents represent a `.gitignore` configuration, which specifies files and directories that should be excluded from version control in a Git repository. It includes system-specific files like `.DS_Store`, build artifacts such as `.build` and `DerivedData`, Swift Package Manager configurations, and user-specific data like `xcuserdata/`. This ensures that unnecessary or sensitive files are not tracked in the repository.
