# Purpose
This Bash script is designed to execute a command-line interface (CLI) application called `llama-cli` with specific parameters and configurations. It provides narrow functionality, primarily serving as a wrapper to launch the `llama-cli` program with predefined options, such as setting the model parameter, enabling color output, and specifying a prompt file. The script allows for some customization through command-line arguments, specifically the ability to specify a model using the `-m` flag. It is not a standalone executable or a library but rather a utility script intended to streamline the execution of the `llama-cli` application with consistent settings, making it easier for users to run the application with the desired configurations without manually entering all the options each time.
