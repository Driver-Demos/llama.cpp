# Purpose
This Bash script is designed to convert a TypeScript type definition into a JSON schema and subsequently into a grammar format. It provides a narrow functionality focused on transforming TypeScript types into a format that can be further processed or analyzed. The script is not an executable or a library but rather a utility script that automates a specific workflow. It takes a TypeScript type as an argument, generates a temporary TypeScript file, and uses the `ts-json-schema-generator` tool to create a JSON schema from this type. Finally, it processes the generated schema with a Python script to convert it into a grammar format. The script is intended for use in environments where TypeScript and JSON schema processing are required, and it includes error handling and cleanup mechanisms to manage temporary files.
