# Purpose
This C++ source code file is an executable program designed to demonstrate the use of a language model, specifically one that appears to be part of a system named "llama." The program initializes and configures a language model, processes a text prompt, and generates a sequence of tokens based on the input. The main functionality revolves around setting up the model with parameters parsed from command-line arguments, generating a prompt with embedded "junk" text and a hidden passkey, and then using the language model to process and generate text. The code includes components for initializing the model and context, tokenizing the input prompt, and managing the sequence of tokens through a batch processing system. It also includes logging for debugging and performance measurement.

The code is structured to handle command-line arguments for configuring the model's behavior, such as the number of junk tokens, the position of the passkey, and other parameters related to the model's attention mechanism. It uses several external components, such as "llama" for model operations and "common" for parameter parsing and tokenization. The program is a standalone executable, as indicated by the presence of a [`main`](#main) function, and it does not define public APIs or external interfaces for use by other programs. The primary purpose of this code is to demonstrate the capabilities of the language model in generating text and handling token sequences, with a focus on performance and correctness in processing the input prompt.

# Functions

---
### print\_usage<!-- {{#callable:print_usage}} -->
The `print_usage` function logs an example command-line usage message for the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `int`: An unused integer parameter, typically representing the argument count.
    - `char ** argv`: An array of C-style strings representing the command-line arguments passed to the program.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by logging a message indicating that it will display example usage.
    - It logs a formatted string showing an example command-line invocation of the program, using the first element of `argv` to represent the program name.
    - The function ends after logging the example usage message.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it outputs the usage message to the log.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes parameters, generates a prompt with a hidden passkey, sets up a language model, and processes the prompt to decode and output the passkey.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of character pointers listing all the arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `common_params` with default values for `n_junk`, `n_keep`, and `i_pos`.
    - Parse command-line arguments to update `params` and check for successful parsing; if unsuccessful, print usage and return 1.
    - Initialize the common backend and set up the prompt with a random passkey inserted at a random position within junk text.
    - Initialize the LLM backend and load the model from a file; if loading fails, log an error and return 1.
    - Initialize the context with parameters derived from `params` and check for successful context creation; if unsuccessful, log an error and return 1.
    - Tokenize the prompt and calculate the total number of tokens, including a margin for generated text.
    - Iterate over the context to fill the KV cache, processing tokens in batches and handling self-extension if necessary.
    - Shift the KV cache as needed to make space for new tokens and continue processing until all tokens are handled.
    - Enter the main loop to sample and decode tokens until the end of generation or the maximum length is reached.
    - Log the decoding performance and free all allocated resources before returning 0.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer status code, 0 for successful execution and 1 for any errors encountered during processing.
