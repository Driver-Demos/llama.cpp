# Purpose
This CMake configuration file defines the build instructions for a C++ executable named "llama-gguf". It specifies the source file "gguf.cpp" for the executable, sets the installation target for the runtime, links the executable with the "ggml" library and thread libraries, and enforces the use of the C++17 standard for compilation.
