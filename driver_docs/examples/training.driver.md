## Files
- **[CMakeLists.txt](training/CMakeLists.txt.driver.md)**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file in `llama.cpp/examples/training` configures the build process for the `llama-finetune` executable, specifying its source file, installation, library dependencies, and C++ standard requirements.
- **[finetune.cpp](training/finetune.cpp.driver.md)**: The `finetune.cpp` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase provides an implementation for fine-tuning a model using specified parameters, including loading the model, applying optimizations, and saving the fine-tuned model.
- **[README.md](training/README.md.driver.md)**: The `README.md` file in `llama.cpp/examples/training` provides instructions and examples for finetuning language models using llama.cpp, including setup for CPU and CUDA training.
