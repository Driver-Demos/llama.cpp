# Purpose
The provided content is a documentation snippet explaining the process of converting a machine learning model from the llama2.c format to a ggml-compatible format. It outlines the necessary steps and options for using a command-line tool, `llama-convert-llama2c-to-ggml`, to perform this conversion. The document specifies the requirement to download the original models from the llama2.c repository and provides details on how to specify the input and output model paths, as well as how to handle vocabulary files. Additionally, it includes an example command for converting a model and a note on using a specific tokenizer for a particular model. The final part demonstrates how to use the converted model with a command-line interface, illustrating the practical application of the conversion process.
