# Purpose
This CMake configuration file defines the build process for an executable named `llama-convert-llama2c-to-ggml`. It specifies the source file `convert-llama2c-to-ggml.cpp` for the executable, sets the installation target, links necessary libraries (`common`, `llama`, and threading libraries), and enforces the use of C++17 standard features during compilation.
