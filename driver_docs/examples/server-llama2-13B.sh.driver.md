# Purpose
This script is a Bash shell script designed to configure and launch a server for a machine learning model, specifically the "llama" model. It begins by setting the script to exit immediately if any command fails (`set -e`) and navigates to the parent directory of the script's location. The script allows users to specify a model file and a prompt template, with default paths provided for both. It also allows configuration of the number of CPU threads to be used, defaulting to 12, and includes options for model generation that can be overridden via command line arguments. The script concludes by executing the `llama-server` with the specified options, model, and threading configuration, and includes a commented-out option for testing with Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) that can be activated if needed.
