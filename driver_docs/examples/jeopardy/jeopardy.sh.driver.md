# Purpose
This Bash script is designed to automate the process of running a series of questions through a language model, specifically the Vicuna model, in a Jeopardy-style format. It is a narrow functionality script that reads questions from a specified text file and processes each question using a command-line interface for the language model, appending the results to an output file. The script sets up necessary variables, such as the model path, model name, and execution options, and iterates over each question, executing a command that includes the question and model parameters. This script is not a standalone executable but rather a utility script intended to facilitate batch processing of questions for a specific application, likely for testing or demonstration purposes.
# Global Variables

---
### MODEL
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `MODEL` variable is a string that holds the file path to a binary model file used by the script. This file is likely a machine learning model, specifically a quantized version of the Vicuna model, which is used for processing or generating text in the script.
- **Use**: This variable is used to specify the model file path for the command executed within the loop, allowing the script to utilize the specified model for text processing tasks.


---
### MODEL\_NAME
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: `MODEL_NAME` is a global variable that holds the name of the model being used, which in this case is 'Vicuna'. It is used to dynamically name output files based on the model name.
- **Use**: This variable is used to create file paths for storing results, ensuring that the output files are named according to the model being utilized.


---
### prefix
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `prefix` variable is a string that holds the value 'Human: '. It is used as a prefix to format input prompts for a game of Jeopardy, indicating the human participant's input.
- **Use**: This variable is used to prepend the string 'Human: ' to the introduction and questions in the command executed within the while loop.


---
### opts
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `opts` variable is a string that contains additional command-line flags used when executing the `llama-cli` command. In this script, it is set to `--temp 0 -n 80`, which likely specifies a temperature setting of 0 and a limit of 80 for some parameter, possibly the number of tokens or characters.
- **Use**: This variable is used to append specific execution options to the command that runs the `llama-cli` tool, affecting its behavior during the script's execution.


---
### nl
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The variable `nl` is a string that contains a newline character. It is used to format text output by inserting a line break where needed.
- **Use**: This variable is used to insert a newline character in the command string that is executed for each question in the Jeopardy game.


---
### introduction
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `introduction` variable is a string that provides a brief description of the game being played, which is Jeopardy. It instructs the user to answer questions in a specific format, such as 'What is Paris' or 'Who is George Washington.'
- **Use**: This variable is used to prepend an introductory message to each question in the Jeopardy game, setting the context for the user.


---
### question\_file
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `question_file` variable is a string that holds the file path to a text file containing Jeopardy questions. This file is located at `./examples/jeopardy/questions.txt`.
- **Use**: This variable is used to specify the input file from which questions are read in a loop for processing.


---
### output\_file
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `output_file` variable is a string that specifies the file path where the results of the Jeopardy game are stored. It is initialized with the path `./examples/jeopardy/results/$MODEL_NAME.txt`, which dynamically incorporates the model name into the file path. This ensures that results are saved in a file named after the model being used, in this case, 'Vicuna'. The file is created or updated at the start of the script using the `touch` command.
- **Use**: This variable is used to direct the output of the Jeopardy game results to a specific file, appending each result to the file as the script processes each question.


---
### counter
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: The `counter` variable is a global integer initialized to 1. It is used to keep track of the number of questions processed in a loop that reads questions from a file.
- **Use**: This variable is incremented by 1 after each question is processed, serving as a simple counter to display the current question number.
