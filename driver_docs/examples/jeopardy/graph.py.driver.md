# Purpose
This Python script is designed to analyze and visualize the performance of different models in a Jeopardy-style question-answering task. The script reads data from a specified directory containing text files with results and a CSV file with the correct answers. It calculates the number of questions each model answered correctly by prompting the user to verify the correctness of each answer. The results are then visualized using a bar chart, where each bar represents a model's performance in terms of the number of questions answered correctly. The script also includes a comparison with a "Human" benchmark, which is hardcoded with a score of 48.11.

The script is structured as a standalone executable program, indicated by the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block, which ensures that the main functionality is executed when the script is run directly. The primary components include the [`calculatecorrect`](#cpp/examples/jeopardy/graphcalculatecorrect) function, which handles data reading and correctness calculation, and the [`bar_chart`](#cpp/examples/jeopardy/graphbar_chart) function, which uses the `matplotlib` library to generate a visual representation of the results. The script does not define public APIs or external interfaces, as its purpose is to be executed as a script rather than imported as a module. The use of global variables for storing labels, numbers, and rows suggests a simple design focused on immediate execution and visualization rather than modularity or reusability.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `matplotlib.pyplot`
- `os`
- `csv`


# Global Variables

---
### labels
- **Type**: `list`
- **Description**: The `labels` variable is a global list that stores the names of models derived from filenames in a specified directory. These names are used as labels on the x-axis of a bar chart to represent different models' performance in a Jeopardy game simulation.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and display the names of models on the x-axis of a bar chart in the `bar_chart` function.


---
### numbers
- **Type**: `list`
- **Description**: The `numbers` variable is a global list that stores the count of correct answers for each model evaluated in the Jeopardy results. It is initially an empty list and is populated with the total number of correct answers for each model as the `calculatecorrect` function processes the results files.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and later display the number of correct answers for each model in a bar chart.


---
### numEntries
- **Type**: `int`
- **Description**: The variable `numEntries` is an integer initialized to 1. It is used to keep track of the number of entries or models processed in the Jeopardy results analysis.
- **Use**: `numEntries` is incremented each time a new result file is processed, and it is used to determine the positions for the bar chart display.


---
### rows
- **Type**: `list`
- **Description**: The `rows` variable is a global list that is initially empty and is used to store rows of data read from a CSV file. It is populated within the `calculatecorrect` function by appending each row from the CSV reader to the list.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and access the data from the CSV file for further processing in the program.


# Functions

---
### bar\_chart<!-- {{#callable:llama.cpp/examples/jeopardy/graph.bar_chart}} -->
The `bar_chart` function creates and displays a bar chart using the provided numerical data and labels.
- **Inputs**:
    - `numbers`: A list of numerical values representing the data to be plotted as bars.
    - `labels`: A list of strings representing the labels for each bar on the x-axis.
    - `pos`: A list of positions on the x-axis where the bars will be placed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses `plt.bar` to create a bar chart with the given positions and numbers, setting the bar color to blue.
    - It sets the x-axis ticks and labels using `plt.xticks` with the provided positions and labels.
    - The chart is titled 'Jeopardy Results by Model' using `plt.title`.
    - The x-axis and y-axis are labeled 'Model' and 'Questions Correct' respectively using `plt.xlabel` and `plt.ylabel`.
    - Finally, the chart is displayed using `plt.show`.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it displays a bar chart as a side effect.


---
### calculatecorrect<!-- {{#callable:llama.cpp/examples/jeopardy/graph.calculatecorrect}} -->
The `calculatecorrect` function processes Jeopardy game results from text files, compares them with correct answers from a CSV file, and records the number of correct answers for each file.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by encoding the directory path where result text files are stored.
    - It reads a CSV file containing questions and answers, appending each row to a global list `rows`.
    - The function iterates over each file in the specified directory, checking if the file has a `.txt` extension.
    - For each text file, it opens the file and initializes a counter `totalcorrect` to track the number of correct answers.
    - It reads each line of the file, printing the line unless it is a separator line (`------`).
    - Upon encountering a separator line, it prints the correct answer from the CSV data and prompts the user to input whether the AI's answer was correct.
    - If the user inputs 'y', it increments the `totalcorrect` counter.
    - After processing all lines in a file, it appends the total number of correct answers to a global list `numbers`.
    - The filename (without extension) is added to a global list `labels`, and a global counter `numEntries` is incremented.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but updates global lists `labels` and `numbers` with the filenames and corresponding counts of correct answers, respectively.
