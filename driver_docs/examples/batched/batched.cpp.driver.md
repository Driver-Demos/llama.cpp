# Purpose
This C++ source code file is an executable program designed to initialize and run a language model using the "llama" library. The primary purpose of the code is to demonstrate how to load a pre-trained language model, tokenize a given input prompt, and generate text sequences based on that prompt. The code provides a command-line interface for users to specify parameters such as the model file, the input prompt, the number of tokens to predict, and the number of parallel sequences to generate. The program is structured around a [`main`](#main) function, which orchestrates the initialization of the model, tokenization of the input, and the iterative process of generating and sampling new tokens to form coherent text sequences.

Key technical components of the code include the initialization of the language model and its context, the tokenization of input prompts, and the use of a sampling mechanism to generate text. The code leverages several functions from the "llama" library to manage these tasks, such as `llama_model_load_from_file` for loading the model, `common_tokenize` for tokenizing the input, and `llama_decode` for generating new tokens. The program also includes error handling to ensure that the model and context are correctly initialized and that the generated sequences fit within the allocated memory. The code is a standalone executable and does not define public APIs or external interfaces, focusing instead on demonstrating the capabilities of the "llama" library for text generation tasks.

# Functions

---
### print\_usage<!-- {{#callable:print_usage}} -->
The `print_usage` function logs an example command-line usage of the program to the console.
- **Inputs**:
    - `int`: An unused integer parameter, typically representing the argument count.
    - `char ** argv`: An array of C-style strings representing the command-line arguments passed to the program.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by logging a message indicating that an example usage will be shown.
    - It then logs a formatted string that includes the program's name (from `argv[0]`) and an example of how to use the program with specific command-line options.
    - Finally, it logs a newline character to separate this output from any subsequent logs.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it outputs the usage information directly to the console via logging.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes and runs a language model to generate text sequences based on a given prompt, handling model loading, context setup, token sampling, and output generation.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of character pointers listing all the arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize common parameters with default prompt and prediction length.
    - Parse command-line arguments to update parameters; exit with error if parsing fails.
    - Initialize common and LLM-specific backends and NUMA settings.
    - Load the language model from a file using the parsed parameters; exit with error if loading fails.
    - Retrieve the vocabulary from the loaded model.
    - Tokenize the prompt using the model's vocabulary.
    - Calculate the required KV cache size based on token list and prediction length.
    - Initialize the context with calculated parameters; exit with error if context creation fails.
    - Initialize a sampler chain with default parameters and add various sampling strategies.
    - Check if the KV cache size is sufficient; exit with error if not.
    - Print the prompt tokens to the log.
    - Initialize a batch for token data submission and evaluate the initial prompt.
    - If the model has an encoder, encode the initial batch and prepare for decoding.
    - Decode the initial batch and handle errors if decoding fails.
    - If multiple parallel sequences are requested, log the start of sequence generation.
    - Enter a loop to generate tokens until the prediction length is reached or all streams are finished.
    - For each parallel sequence, sample the next token, check for end-of-generation, and update streams.
    - If all streams are finished, break the loop.
    - Evaluate the current batch with the model and handle errors if evaluation fails.
    - Log the generated sequences if multiple parallel sequences were requested.
    - Calculate and log the performance metrics for the decoding process.
    - Free allocated resources for batch, sampler, context, model, and backend before exiting.
- **Output**: Returns 0 on successful execution, or 1 if any error occurs during parameter parsing, model loading, context creation, or decoding.
