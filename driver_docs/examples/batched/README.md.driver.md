# Purpose
The provided content is an example script demonstrating the use of a command-line tool for batched text generation using a language model, specifically the "llama-batched" executable. The script showcases how to generate multiple sequences of text from a given prompt, "Hello my name is," using a pre-trained model located at "./models/llama-7b-v2/ggml-model-f16.gguf". The example specifies parameters such as the number of parallel sequences to generate (4 in this case) and provides output for each sequence, illustrating the model's ability to generate diverse continuations of the prompt. Additionally, the script includes performance metrics, such as load time, sample time, and evaluation time, offering insights into the efficiency and speed of the text generation process. This example serves as a practical demonstration for users to understand how to utilize the tool for generating text in a batched manner.
