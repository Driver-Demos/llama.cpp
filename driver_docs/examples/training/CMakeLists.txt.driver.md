# Purpose
This CMake configuration file defines the build process for a C++ executable named "llama-finetune" from the source file "finetune.cpp". It specifies the installation of the executable, links it with the libraries "common", "llama", and thread libraries, and enforces the use of C++11 standard features during compilation.
