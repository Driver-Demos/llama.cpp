# Purpose
The provided content is a CMake configuration file used to define the build process for a software project. It specifies the creation of an executable named `llama-gguf-hash` from the source file `gguf-hash.cpp`. The file includes dependencies from a directory named `deps/`, and it links the executable with several libraries, including `xxhash`, `sha1`, and `sha256`, which are built as object libraries from their respective source files. Additionally, it sets the C++ standard to C++17 for compiling the target and includes a conditional compilation option to suppress warnings in third-party code when not using the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler. The configuration ensures that the necessary libraries and compile options are correctly set up for building the executable.
