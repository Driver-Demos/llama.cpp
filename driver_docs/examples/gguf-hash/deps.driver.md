## Folders
- **[rotate-bits](deps/rotate-bits.driver.md)**: The `rotate-bits` folder in the `llama.cpp` codebase contains a `package.json` file for package metadata and a `rotate-bits.h` file defining macros for bit rotation operations.
- **[sha1](deps/sha1.driver.md)**: The `sha1` folder in the `llama.cpp` codebase contains files related to the implementation and metadata of the SHA-1 hashing algorithm, including a `package.json` for package details and `sha1.c` and `sha1.h` for the algorithm's C implementation.
- **[sha256](deps/sha256.driver.md)**: The `sha256` folder in the `llama.cpp` codebase contains files related to the implementation and configuration of a SHA-256 hashing algorithm in C, including source code, function definitions, and package metadata.
- **[xxhash](deps/xxhash.driver.md)**: The `xxhash` folder in the `llama.cpp` codebase contains the implementation and metadata for the xxHash library, including its source code and header files for fast non-cryptographic hashing algorithms.
