## Files
- **[clib.json](xxhash/clib.json.driver.md)**: The `clib.json` file specifies metadata for the `xxhash` library, including its version, repository, description, keywords, license, and source files.
- **[xxhash.c](xxhash/xxhash.c.driver.md)**: The `xxhash.c` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase provides the implementation of the extremely fast xxHash algorithm by instantiating functions defined in `xxhash.h`.
- **[xxhash.h](xxhash/xxhash.h.driver.md)**: The `xxhash.h` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase is a comprehensive header for the xxHash library, providing highly efficient non-cryptographic hash algorithms like XXH32, XXH64, and XXH3 with 64-bit and 128-bit outputs, supporting both single-shot and streaming APIs, and offering optimizations for various architectures, customization options, and detailed documentation for easy integration.
