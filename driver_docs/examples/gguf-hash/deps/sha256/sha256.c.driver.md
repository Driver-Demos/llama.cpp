# Purpose
The provided C source code file implements the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function. This file is part of a cryptographic library and is designed to compute a fixed-size 256-bit hash value from input data of arbitrary size. The code is based on public domain code from Wei Dai's Crypto++ library and has been optimized for speed with unrolling techniques. The file includes several key components: initialization of the hash state, processing of data blocks, and finalization of the hash computation. The [`sha256_init`](#sha256_init), [`sha256_update`](#sha256_update), and [`sha256_final`](#sha256_final) functions are the primary public interfaces for initializing the hash state, updating it with data, and finalizing the hash to produce the digest, respectively.

The code defines several macros and constants that are essential for the SHA-256 algorithm, such as bitwise operations and the SHA-256 constants array `K`. The [`sha256_transform`](#sha256_transform) function is a core component that processes 512-bit blocks of data, updating the hash state with each block. The file also includes optimizations through conditional compilation directives, allowing for different levels of loop unrolling to enhance performance. This implementation is intended to be used as part of a larger cryptographic library, providing a reliable and efficient means of generating SHA-256 hashes, which are widely used in security applications for data integrity and authentication.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `rotate-bits/rotate-bits.h`
- `sha256.h`


# Global Variables

---
### K
- **Type**: ``static const uint32_t[64]``
- **Description**: The variable `K` is a static constant array of 64 unsigned 32-bit integers. It contains a series of predefined constants used in the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function. These constants are derived from the fractional parts of the cube roots of the first 64 prime numbers.
- **Use**: `K` is used in the SHA-256 transformation process to perform bitwise operations and calculations essential for generating the hash.


# Functions

---
### sha256\_init<!-- {{#callable:sha256_init}} -->
The `sha256_init` function initializes a SHA-256 context structure with predefined initial hash values and resets the message length counter.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A pointer to a `sha256_t` structure that will be initialized.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Set the first element of the state array to 0x6a09e667.
    - Set the second element of the state array to 0xbb67ae85.
    - Set the third element of the state array to 0x3c6ef372.
    - Set the fourth element of the state array to 0xa54ff53a.
    - Set the fifth element of the state array to 0x510e527f.
    - Set the sixth element of the state array to 0x9b05688c.
    - Set the seventh element of the state array to 0x1f83d9ab.
    - Set the eighth element of the state array to 0x5be0cd19.
    - Reset the count to 0.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `sha256_t` structure pointed to by `p`.


---
### sha256\_transform<!-- {{#callable:sha256_transform}} -->
The `sha256_transform` function processes a 512-bit block of data to update the SHA-256 hash state.
- **Inputs**:
    - `state`: A pointer to an array of 8 uint32_t values representing the current state of the hash.
    - `data`: A pointer to an array of 16 uint32_t values representing the 512-bit block of data to be processed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a working array W of 16 uint32_t elements to zero.
    - Depending on the compilation flags, either initialize individual variables a-h from the state or copy the state into an array T.
    - Iterate over 64 steps in chunks of 16, applying the RX_8 macro to process the data in unrolled loops if the unroll flags are defined, otherwise use a loop with the R macro.
    - After processing, update the state array by adding the working variables a-h or the array T back to the state, depending on the compilation flags.
    - Commented out code suggests wiping the working variables W and T for security reasons, but this is not executed.
- **Output**: The function updates the `state` array to reflect the processed hash state after transforming the input data block.

### sha256\_write\_byte\_block<!-- {{#callable:sha256_write_byte_block}} -->
The `sha256_write_byte_block` function processes a 64-byte block from the SHA-256 buffer, converting it into 16 32-bit words and then transforming the hash state using these words.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A pointer to a `sha256_t` structure, which contains the buffer and state for the SHA-256 computation.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize an array `data32` of 16 `uint32_t` elements to store the converted 32-bit words.
    - Iterate over 16 elements, each representing a 4-byte segment of the buffer.
    - For each iteration, convert four consecutive bytes from the buffer into a single 32-bit word and store it in `data32`.
    - Call [`sha256_transform`](#sha256_transform) with the current state and the `data32` array to update the hash state.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the state of the `sha256_t` structure pointed to by `p`.
