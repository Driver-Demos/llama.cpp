# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines the interface for implementing the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function. It includes necessary standard libraries and defines a constant for the size of the SHA-256 digest. The `sha256_t` structure is declared to maintain the state of the hash computation, including the current hash state, a count of processed bytes, and a buffer for data. The file declares four functions: [`sha256_init`](#sha256_init) to initialize the hash state, [`sha256_update`](#sha256_update) to process data in chunks, [`sha256_final`](#sha256_final) to finalize the hash and produce the digest, and [`sha256_hash`](#sha256_hash) to compute the hash of a complete data buffer in one step. This header file is designed to be included in C source files that require SHA-256 hashing functionality.

# Data Structures

---
### sha256\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `state`: An array of 8 uint32_t values representing the current state of the hash computation.
    - `count`: A uint64_t value that keeps track of the total number of bits processed.
    - `buffer`: A 64-byte buffer used to store data blocks that are being processed.
- **Description**: The `sha256_t` structure is used to maintain the state of a SHA-256 hash computation. It includes an array `state` to hold the intermediate hash values, a `count` to track the number of bits processed, and a `buffer` to temporarily store data blocks during the hashing process. This structure is essential for performing the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, allowing for initialization, updating with data, and finalizing to produce the hash digest.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### sha256\_init<!-- {{#callable_declaration:sha256_init}} -->
Initialize a SHA-256 context structure.
- **Description**: Use this function to prepare a `sha256_t` structure for a new SHA-256 hashing operation. It must be called before any other operations on the `sha256_t` structure, such as updating with data or finalizing the hash. This function sets the initial state and count of the SHA-256 context, ensuring it is ready to process data.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A pointer to a `sha256_t` structure that will be initialized. Must not be null. The caller retains ownership and is responsible for ensuring the structure is properly allocated before calling this function.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`sha256_init`](sha256.c.driver.md#sha256_init)  (Implementation)


---
### sha256\_update<!-- {{#callable_declaration:sha256_update}} -->
Updates the SHA-256 context with new data.
- **Description**: Use this function to process a block of data and update the SHA-256 hash context accordingly. It should be called after initializing the context with `sha256_init` and can be called multiple times to process data in chunks. The function accumulates the data into the context's buffer and processes it in 64-byte blocks. Ensure that the context pointer is valid and initialized before calling this function. This function does not produce a final hash; call `sha256_final` to retrieve the hash after all data has been processed.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A pointer to a `sha256_t` structure representing the SHA-256 context. Must not be null and should be initialized using `sha256_init` before calling this function. The caller retains ownership.
    - `data`: A pointer to the data to be hashed. Must not be null. The caller retains ownership of the data.
    - `size`: The size of the data in bytes. Must be a non-negative value. If zero, the function does nothing.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`sha256_update`](sha256.c.driver.md#sha256_update)  (Implementation)


---
### sha256\_final<!-- {{#callable_declaration:sha256_final}} -->
Completes the SHA-256 hash computation and outputs the final digest.
- **Description**: This function finalizes the SHA-256 hashing process by padding the current data, processing any remaining data blocks, and writing the resulting hash to the provided digest buffer. It must be called after all data has been input using `sha256_update`. After calling this function, the `sha256_t` structure is re-initialized, allowing it to be reused for a new hash computation. The function does not handle null pointers, so valid pointers must be provided.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A pointer to a `sha256_t` structure that has been initialized with `sha256_init` and updated with data using `sha256_update`. Must not be null.
    - `digest`: A pointer to a buffer where the final 32-byte SHA-256 hash will be stored. The buffer must be at least 32 bytes in size. Must not be null.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`sha256_final`](sha256.c.driver.md#sha256_final)  (Implementation)


---
### sha256\_hash<!-- {{#callable_declaration:sha256_hash}} -->
Computes the SHA-256 hash of the input data.
- **Description**: Use this function to compute the SHA-256 hash of a given data buffer. It processes the input data and writes the resulting 32-byte hash into the provided output buffer. This function is useful when you need a secure hash of data for purposes such as data integrity verification or cryptographic operations. Ensure that the output buffer is large enough to hold the SHA-256 hash, which is 32 bytes. The input data can be of any size, and the function handles the hashing process internally.
- **Inputs**:
    - `buf`: A pointer to an unsigned char array where the resulting 32-byte SHA-256 hash will be stored. Must not be null and must have at least 32 bytes allocated.
    - `data`: A pointer to the input data to be hashed. Must not be null. The data can be of any size.
    - `size`: The size of the input data in bytes. Must accurately represent the number of bytes in the data buffer.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`sha256_hash`](sha256.c.driver.md#sha256_hash)  (Implementation)
