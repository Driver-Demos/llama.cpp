# Purpose
This code is a C header file that provides the interface for implementing the SHA-1 cryptographic hash function. It defines a structure, `SHA1_CTX`, which is used to maintain the state of the hash computation, including the current hash state, a count of processed bits, and a buffer for input data. The file declares several functions: [`SHA1Transform`](#SHA1Transform) for processing data blocks, [`SHA1Init`](#SHA1Init) for initializing the hash context, [`SHA1Update`](#SHA1Update) for updating the hash with new data, [`SHA1Final`](#SHA1Final) for finalizing the hash and producing the output digest, and [`SHA1`](#SHA1) for computing the hash of a given string directly. The header is designed to be compatible with both C and C++ environments, as indicated by the use of `extern "C"` to prevent name mangling when included in C++ projects.

# Data Structures

---
### SHA1\_CTX
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `state`: An array of five 32-bit unsigned integers used to maintain the state of the hash computation.
    - `count`: An array of two 32-bit unsigned integers used to keep track of the number of bits processed.
    - `buffer`: A 64-byte buffer used to store data blocks that are being processed.
- **Description**: The `SHA1_CTX` structure is used to maintain the state of a SHA-1 hash computation. It contains three main components: `state`, which holds the current state of the hash; `count`, which tracks the number of bits processed so far; and `buffer`, which temporarily stores data blocks that are being processed. This structure is essential for the incremental processing of data in the SHA-1 algorithm, allowing for the hash to be computed over multiple updates.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### SHA1Transform<!-- {{#callable_declaration:SHA1Transform}} -->
Performs the SHA-1 transformation on a data block.
- **Description**: This function is used to perform the core transformation of the SHA-1 hashing algorithm on a 64-byte block of data. It updates the provided state array, which represents the current hash value, by processing the input buffer. This function is typically called internally by higher-level functions that manage the SHA-1 hashing process, such as SHA1Update. It is crucial that the state array is properly initialized before calling this function, and the buffer must contain exactly 64 bytes of data. The function does not handle any input validation, so it is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the inputs are valid.
- **Inputs**:
    - `state`: An array of five 32-bit unsigned integers representing the current state of the hash. This array must be initialized before calling the function, and it will be updated with the new state after processing the buffer. The caller retains ownership.
    - `buffer`: A constant array of 64 unsigned characters representing the data block to be transformed. This buffer must contain exactly 64 bytes of data, and the caller retains ownership. The function does not modify this buffer.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`SHA1Transform`](sha1.c.driver.md#SHA1Transform)  (Implementation)


---
### SHA1Init<!-- {{#callable_declaration:SHA1Init}} -->
Initialize a SHA1_CTX structure for SHA-1 hashing.
- **Description**: Use this function to prepare a SHA1_CTX structure for a new SHA-1 hashing operation. It sets the initial state and count values required for the SHA-1 algorithm. This function must be called before any other SHA-1 operations, such as SHA1Update or SHA1Final, to ensure the context is properly initialized. The function does not perform any memory allocation, so the caller must ensure that the context parameter points to a valid SHA1_CTX structure.
- **Inputs**:
    - `context`: A pointer to a SHA1_CTX structure that will be initialized. Must not be null. The caller is responsible for allocating and managing the memory for this structure.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`SHA1Init`](sha1.c.driver.md#SHA1Init)  (Implementation)


---
### SHA1Update<!-- {{#callable_declaration:SHA1Update}} -->
Updates the SHA-1 context with a portion of the message.
- **Description**: Use this function to process a segment of the input data for SHA-1 hashing. It must be called after initializing the SHA1_CTX structure with SHA1Init and can be called multiple times with successive portions of the message to be hashed. The function updates the context with the provided data, which can be of any length. It is important to ensure that the context is not null and has been properly initialized before calling this function. The function does not return a value, and the context is modified in place to reflect the updated hash state.
- **Inputs**:
    - `context`: A pointer to a SHA1_CTX structure that holds the current state of the hash computation. Must not be null and should be initialized using SHA1Init before use. The context is updated in place.
    - `data`: A pointer to the data to be hashed. The data can be of any length and must not be null.
    - `len`: The length of the data in bytes. It should accurately reflect the size of the data buffer.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`SHA1Update`](sha1.c.driver.md#SHA1Update)  (Implementation)


---
### SHA1Final<!-- {{#callable_declaration:SHA1Final}} -->
Finalizes the SHA-1 hash computation and produces the message digest.
- **Description**: This function completes the SHA-1 hashing process by finalizing the hash computation and storing the resulting 20-byte message digest in the provided buffer. It must be called after all data has been processed using SHA1Update. The function also clears the SHA1_CTX structure to prevent sensitive data from lingering in memory. It is essential to ensure that the context has been properly initialized with SHA1Init and updated with all necessary data before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `digest`: A buffer of at least 20 bytes where the final SHA-1 hash will be stored. The caller must ensure this buffer is allocated and has sufficient space.
    - `context`: A pointer to an initialized SHA1_CTX structure that has been updated with the data to be hashed. The context must not be null and should have been previously initialized with SHA1Init.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`SHA1Final`](sha1.c.driver.md#SHA1Final)  (Implementation)


---
### SHA1<!-- {{#callable_declaration:SHA1}} -->
Computes the SHA-1 hash of a given input string.
- **Description**: Use this function to compute the SHA-1 hash of a specified input string. It processes the input data and produces a 20-byte hash value, which is stored in the provided output buffer. This function is typically used for cryptographic purposes, such as data integrity verification. Ensure that the output buffer is large enough to hold the 20-byte hash. The input string is processed byte by byte, and the function must be called with a valid string and length. It is important to note that the function does not perform any internal validation of the input parameters, so the caller must ensure that the input string is valid and the length is correctly specified.
- **Inputs**:
    - `hash_out`: A pointer to a buffer where the resulting 20-byte SHA-1 hash will be stored. The buffer must be allocated by the caller and must be at least 20 bytes in size. The caller retains ownership of the buffer.
    - `str`: A pointer to the input string to be hashed. The string must be valid and can contain any data, including null bytes. The caller retains ownership of the string.
    - `len`: The length of the input string in bytes. It must accurately reflect the number of bytes to be processed from the input string.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`SHA1`](sha1.c.driver.md#SHA1)  (Implementation)
