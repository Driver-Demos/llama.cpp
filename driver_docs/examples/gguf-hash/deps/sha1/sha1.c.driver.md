# Purpose
This C source code file implements the SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) cryptographic hash function. The code provides a complete implementation of the SHA-1 algorithm, which is used to produce a 160-bit hash value from an arbitrary block of data. The file includes several key functions: [`SHA1Init`](#SHA1Init), [`SHA1Update`](#SHA1Update), [`SHA1Final`](#SHA1Final), and [`SHA1Transform`](#SHA1Transform), which together manage the initialization, processing, and finalization of the hash computation. The [`SHA1Transform`](#SHA1Transform) function is the core of the algorithm, performing the main hashing operations on 512-bit blocks of data. The code also includes a utility function [`SHA1`](#SHA1) that provides a simplified interface for hashing a string of data.

The file is designed to be a standalone implementation of the SHA-1 algorithm, with no external dependencies beyond standard C libraries. It defines macros and functions to handle data in both little-endian and big-endian byte orders, ensuring compatibility across different systems. The code is structured to be used as a library, allowing other programs to include it and utilize its hashing capabilities. The implementation is public domain, making it freely available for use and modification. The file does not define a main function, indicating that it is intended to be integrated into other applications rather than executed independently.

# Data Structures

### CHAR64LONG16
- **Type**: `union`
- **Members**:
    - `c`: An array of 64 unsigned characters.
    - `l`: An array of 16 32-bit unsigned integers.
- **Description**: The `CHAR64LONG16` union is a data structure used in the SHA-1 hashing algorithm implementation. It provides a way to access a 512-bit block of data as either an array of 64 bytes or as an array of 16 32-bit words, facilitating operations that require different views of the same data for processing during the hash computation.


# Functions

---
### SHA1Transform<!-- {{#callable:SHA1Transform}} -->
The `SHA1Transform` function processes a single 512-bit block of data to update the SHA-1 hash state.
- **Inputs**:
    - `state`: An array of five 32-bit unsigned integers representing the current state of the SHA-1 hash.
    - `buffer`: A 64-byte array containing the data block to be processed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Declare local variables a, b, c, d, e to hold the working state of the hash.
    - Define a union CHAR64LONG16 to facilitate byte and long access to the data block.
    - Copy the input buffer into a local block if SHA1HANDSOFF is defined, otherwise cast the buffer to a block pointer.
    - Initialize the working variables a, b, c, d, e with the current state values.
    - Perform 80 operations divided into 4 rounds (R0, R1, R2, R3, R4) of 20 operations each, using the SHA-1 specific functions and macros.
    - Update the state array by adding the working variables back to the current state.
    - Clear the working variables and, if SHA1HANDSOFF is defined, clear the block memory.
- **Output**: The function updates the input state array to reflect the processed hash state after transforming the input data block.


---
### SHA1Init<!-- {{#callable:SHA1Init}} -->
The `SHA1Init` function initializes a SHA1_CTX structure with the standard SHA-1 initial hash values and resets the message length counters.
- **Inputs**:
    - `context`: A pointer to a SHA1_CTX structure that will be initialized with SHA-1 constants and reset counters.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Set the first element of the context's state array to 0x67452301.
    - Set the second element of the context's state array to 0xEFCDAB89.
    - Set the third element of the context's state array to 0x98BADCFE.
    - Set the fourth element of the context's state array to 0x10325476.
    - Set the fifth element of the context's state array to 0xC3D2E1F0.
    - Initialize both elements of the context's count array to 0.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the SHA1_CTX structure pointed to by the input argument.


---
### SHA1Update<!-- {{#callable:SHA1Update}} -->
The `SHA1Update` function processes input data in chunks, updating the SHA-1 context with the hash of the data.
- **Inputs**:
    - `context`: A pointer to a `SHA1_CTX` structure that holds the current state of the SHA-1 computation.
    - `data`: A pointer to the input data to be hashed, represented as an array of unsigned characters.
    - `len`: The length of the input data in bytes, represented as a 32-bit unsigned integer.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize local variables `i` and `j` to zero.
    - Store the current bit count from `context->count[0]` into `j`.
    - Update the bit count in `context->count[0]` by adding `len << 3` and check for overflow to increment `context->count[1]`.
    - Calculate the byte offset `j` within the 64-byte buffer using `(j >> 3) & 63`.
    - Check if the current data plus existing buffer data exceeds 64 bytes.
    - If it does, copy enough data to fill the buffer, call [`SHA1Transform`](#SHA1Transform) to process the buffer, and continue processing full 64-byte chunks of the input data.
    - If the data does not exceed 64 bytes, copy the data directly into the buffer starting at the calculated offset `j`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it updates the `SHA1_CTX` structure with the new hash state.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`SHA1Transform`](#SHA1Transform)


---
### SHA1Final<!-- {{#callable:SHA1Final}} -->
The `SHA1Final` function finalizes the SHA-1 hash computation by padding the input data, processing any remaining data, and producing the final hash digest.
- **Inputs**:
    - `digest`: An array of 20 unsigned characters where the final SHA-1 hash will be stored.
    - `context`: A pointer to a `SHA1_CTX` structure that holds the current state of the SHA-1 computation.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize an array `finalcount` to store the bit count of the input data in a big-endian format.
    - Convert the bit count from the `context` into a byte sequence and store it in `finalcount`.
    - Append a padding byte (0x80) to the data using [`SHA1Update`](#SHA1Update).
    - Continue padding with zero bytes until the data length is congruent to 448 modulo 512.
    - Append the `finalcount` to the data, which should trigger a final `SHA1Transform` call.
    - Extract the final hash value from the `context` state and store it in the `digest` array.
    - Clear the `context` and `finalcount` to prevent sensitive data from lingering in memory.
- **Output**: The function outputs the final SHA-1 hash as a 20-byte array stored in the `digest` parameter.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`SHA1Update`](#SHA1Update)


---
### SHA1<!-- {{#callable:SHA1}} -->
The `SHA1` function computes the SHA-1 hash of a given input string and outputs the hash value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `hash_out`: A pointer to a character array where the resulting SHA-1 hash will be stored.
    - `str`: A constant character pointer to the input string that needs to be hashed.
    - `len`: An unsigned 32-bit integer representing the length of the input string.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a SHA1_CTX structure to set up the SHA-1 context.
    - Iterate over each byte of the input string, updating the SHA-1 context with each byte using the [`SHA1Update`](#SHA1Update) function.
    - Finalize the SHA-1 computation by calling [`SHA1Final`](#SHA1Final), which adds padding and computes the final hash value.
    - Store the resulting hash in the `hash_out` array.
- **Output**: The function outputs the SHA-1 hash of the input string in the `hash_out` array, which is a 20-byte (160-bit) hash value.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`SHA1Init`](#SHA1Init)
    - [`SHA1Update`](#SHA1Update)
    - [`SHA1Final`](#SHA1Final)
