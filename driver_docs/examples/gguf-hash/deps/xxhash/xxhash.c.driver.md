# Purpose
The provided code is part of the xxHash library, which is designed to offer an extremely fast hash algorithm. This particular file, `xxhash.c`, serves as the implementation file for the functions declared in the `xxhash.h` header. It is intended to be compiled and linked with other components of a software project that requires hashing functionality. The file includes preprocessor directives such as `#define XXH_STATIC_LINKING_ONLY` and `#define XXH_IMPLEMENTATION`, which enable access to advanced declarations and definitions within the `xxhash.h` file. This setup allows the file to instantiate the functions and make them available for use in applications that require efficient hashing operations.

The xxHash library is known for its speed and efficiency, making it suitable for scenarios where performance is critical, such as data integrity checks, file comparisons, and other applications requiring fast hash computations. The code is distributed under the BSD 2-Clause License, which permits both source and binary redistribution with minimal restrictions, making it a flexible choice for both open-source and proprietary projects. The file does not define a public API directly but rather implements the core functionality that can be accessed through the `xxhash.h` interface, ensuring that the library's hashing capabilities are encapsulated and easily integrated into other software systems.
