# Purpose
The provided content is a documentation snippet for a retrieval example using the `llama.cpp` library, which demonstrates a simple retrieval technique based on cosine similarity. This example involves chunking and embedding text from specified files, allowing users to input queries and receive the most similar text chunks from the embedded files. The parameters for the `retrieval.cpp` tool include options for specifying context files, chunk size, and chunk separators, enabling flexible configuration for text processing. The example command provided illustrates how to compile and execute the retrieval process, showcasing the retrieval of top-k similar text chunks along with their file names, positions, and similarity scores in response to user queries. This functionality is particularly useful for applications requiring efficient text retrieval and similarity analysis.
