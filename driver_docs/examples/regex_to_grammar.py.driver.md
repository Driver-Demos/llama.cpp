# Purpose
This Python script is a command-line utility designed to convert a JSON schema pattern into a grammar format using an external script named `json_schema_to_grammar.py`. It provides narrow functionality, focusing specifically on processing a string pattern provided as a command-line argument. The script first ensures that at least one argument (the pattern) is provided, then constructs a JSON object with a "type" of "string" and the specified "pattern". This JSON object is passed as input to the `json_schema_to_grammar.py` script, which is executed via a subprocess call. The script is useful for users who need to transform JSON schema patterns into a different format, likely for further processing or validation purposes.
