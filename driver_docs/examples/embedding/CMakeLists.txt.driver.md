# Purpose
This CMake configuration file defines the build process for a C++ executable named "llama-embedding." It specifies the source file "embedding.cpp" for the executable, sets the installation rules for the runtime, links the executable with the "common," "llama," and thread libraries, and enforces the use of the C++17 standard for compilation.
