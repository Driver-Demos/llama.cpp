# Purpose
The provided content is a documentation excerpt for using the `llama.cpp` tool to generate high-dimensional embedding vectors from text. It includes instructions for executing the `llama-embedding` command on both Unix-based and Windows systems, specifying the necessary command-line arguments such as the model path, pooling method, and text input. The document details additional parameters for customizing the embedding process, such as normalization methods (`--embd-normalize`), output formats (`--embd-output-format`), and separators for multiple embeddings (`--embd-separator`). Examples are provided to illustrate how to run the command with different configurations, demonstrating the tool's flexibility in handling various text inputs and output requirements. This documentation is essential for users who need to understand how to effectively utilize the `llama.cpp` tool for text embedding tasks.
