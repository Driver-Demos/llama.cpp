# Purpose
The provided content is a CMake configuration file used to define the build process for a set of executable targets within a software project. Each block of commands sets up a different executable target, such as `llama-lookup`, `llama-lookup-create`, `llama-lookup-merge`, and `llama-lookup-stats`, by specifying the source file (e.g., `lookup.cpp`, `lookup-create.cpp`) and linking necessary libraries (`common`, `llama`, and threading libraries). The `install` command ensures that the compiled executables are placed in the appropriate runtime directory upon installation. Additionally, the `target_compile_features` command enforces the use of C++17 standard features for each target, ensuring compatibility and leveraging modern C++ capabilities. This configuration facilitates a streamlined and consistent build process across multiple related executables in the project.
