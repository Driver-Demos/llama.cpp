# Purpose
This C++ source code file is an executable program designed to merge multiple lookup cache files into a single consolidated file. The program is structured around a [`main`](#main) function, which serves as the entry point for execution. It begins by checking the command-line arguments to ensure that at least two input files and one output file are specified. The program then iterates over the input files, loading each one into a `common_ngram_cache` object using the `common_ngram_cache_load` function. These individual caches are subsequently merged into a single cache using the `common_ngram_cache_merge` function. Finally, the merged cache is saved to the specified output file using the `common_ngram_cache_save` function.

The code includes several header files, such as "ggml.h", "llama.h", "common.h", and "ngram-cache.h", which likely provide the necessary definitions and functions for handling n-gram caches. The program uses standard C++ libraries like `<vector>`, `<string>`, and `<iostream>` to manage dynamic arrays, strings, and input/output operations, respectively. The primary functionality of this code is narrow, focusing specifically on the task of merging n-gram cache files, which suggests it is part of a larger system dealing with language models or data processing tasks that require efficient lookup operations. The code does not define public APIs or external interfaces, as it is intended to be executed directly from the command line.

# Functions

---
### print\_usage<!-- {{#callable:print_usage}} -->
The `print_usage` function outputs a usage message to the standard error stream, detailing how to use the program to merge multiple lookup cache files.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argv0`: The name of the program as invoked from the command line, typically the first argument in the `argv` array.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses `fprintf` to print a description of the program's purpose to `stderr`.
    - It then prints the usage syntax, including the program name and expected arguments, to `stderr`.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it outputs text to the standard error stream.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function merges multiple n-gram cache files into a single file, handling command-line arguments and providing usage instructions.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of C-style strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the number of arguments is less than 3; if so, print usage instructions and exit with an error code.
    - Initialize a vector of strings to store the arguments, excluding the program name.
    - Iterate over the arguments to check for help flags ('-h' or '--help'); if found, print usage instructions and exit successfully.
    - Load the first file specified in the arguments into a `common_ngram_cache` object named `ngram_cache_merged`.
    - Iterate over the remaining input files, load each into a `common_ngram_cache` object, and merge it into `ngram_cache_merged`.
    - Save the merged n-gram cache to the file specified by the last argument.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value, but it performs file operations to merge and save n-gram caches.
