# Purpose
This C++ source code file is an executable program designed to interact with a language model, specifically utilizing the "llama" library for natural language processing tasks. The program's primary function is to process input text, tokenize it, and then generate predictions or continuations of the text using a language model. It achieves this by initializing the necessary components, such as the model and context, and then performing tokenization and decoding operations. The code also manages n-gram caches to optimize the prediction process, allowing for speculative token generation and acceptance based on matches with the model's output.

The program is structured around a main function that orchestrates the entire process, from parsing command-line arguments to initializing the model and context, and finally generating and logging the output. Key components include the initialization of the llama model, tokenization of input prompts, and the use of n-gram caches to enhance prediction efficiency. The code also includes mechanisms for handling static and dynamic lookup caches, which are used to store and retrieve n-gram data. Additionally, the program logs various performance metrics, such as encoding and decoding speeds, and the number of tokens processed, providing insights into the efficiency of the language model's operations. Overall, this file serves as a comprehensive example of how to implement a language model-based text processing application using the llama library.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes and runs a language model using the llama library, processing input tokens and generating output tokens while managing n-gram caches and logging performance metrics.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of C-style strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Parse command-line arguments into a `common_params` structure.
    - Initialize common settings and llama backend.
    - Load the language model and its context from parameters.
    - Tokenize the input prompt and initialize n-gram caches.
    - Check if the input prompt exceeds the maximum allowed token size and log an error if it does.
    - Decode the input tokens using the llama model context.
    - Initialize a sampler and a batch for token processing.
    - Enter a loop to sample and process tokens, updating caches and logging results.
    - Check for end-of-sequence or prediction limits to break the loop.
    - Merge and save dynamic n-gram cache updates.
    - Log performance metrics and free resources before exiting.
- **Output**: Returns 0 on successful execution, or 1 if there is an error in parsing parameters or if the input prompt is too long.
