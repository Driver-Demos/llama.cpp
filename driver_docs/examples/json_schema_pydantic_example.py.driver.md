# Purpose
This Python script is designed to interact with a chat completion API, specifically one that is compatible with OpenAI's endpoint, to generate structured responses in JSON format. The script leverages the Pydantic library to define data models and validate JSON responses against these models. The primary function, `create_completion`, sends a request to a specified endpoint with a message payload and an optional response model. If a response model is provided, it uses Pydantic's `TypeAdapter` to generate a JSON schema, ensuring that the API's response adheres to the expected structure. The script also includes an alternative implementation using the `instructor` and `openai` libraries, which is commented out, indicating flexibility in how the API interaction can be handled.

The script defines two Pydantic models, `QAPair` and `PyramidalSummary`, which are used to structure the expected response data. These models enforce strict schema validation, as indicated by the `extra = 'forbid'` configuration, which disallows additional properties not defined in the model. The script is intended to be run as a standalone program, as evidenced by the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block, which demonstrates the creation of a pyramidal summary of a document using the `create_completion` function. This script is a practical example of how to use Pydantic for JSON schema validation in API interactions, providing a robust mechanism for ensuring data integrity and structure in responses.

# Classes

---
### QAPair<!-- {{#class:llama.cpp/examples/json_schema_pydantic_example.QAPair}} -->
- **Decorators**: `@dataclass`
- **Members**:
    - `question`: A string representing the question in the QA pair.
    - `concise_answer`: A string providing a concise answer to the question.
    - `justification`: A string explaining the reasoning behind the answer.
    - `stars`: An integer annotated to be between 1 and 5, representing a rating.
- **Description**: The QAPair class is a Pydantic model designed to represent a question and answer pair, including a concise answer, a justification for the answer, and a star rating between 1 and 5. It is configured to disallow extra fields in its JSON representation, ensuring strict adherence to its defined schema.
- **Inherits From**:
    - `BaseModel`


---
### Config<!-- {{#class:llama.cpp/examples/json_schema_pydantic_example.PyramidalSummary.Config}} -->
- **Members**:
    - `extra`: Specifies that additional properties are forbidden in the JSON schema.
- **Description**: The `Config` class is a configuration class used within Pydantic models to enforce strict schema validation by forbidding additional properties not explicitly defined in the model, ensuring that the JSON schema generated does not allow any extra fields.


---
### PyramidalSummary<!-- {{#class:llama.cpp/examples/json_schema_pydantic_example.PyramidalSummary}} -->
- **Decorators**: `@dataclass`
- **Members**:
    - `title`: Title of the pyramidal summary.
    - `summary`: Brief summary of the content.
    - `question_answers`: List of question and answer pairs with a minimum length of 2.
    - `sub_sections`: Optional list of sub-sections, each being a PyramidalSummary, with a minimum length of 2.
- **Description**: The PyramidalSummary class is a Pydantic model designed to represent a structured summary of a document, with a hierarchical format that includes a title, a brief summary, and a list of question-answer pairs. It supports nested sub-sections, allowing for a detailed breakdown of content into smaller, manageable parts. The class enforces strict schema validation by forbidding extra fields, ensuring that only defined attributes are included in the JSON representation.
- **Inherits From**:
    - `BaseModel`
