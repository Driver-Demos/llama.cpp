# Purpose
This code is a Vim script plugin that provides a narrow functionality, specifically designed to interact with a local server for text completion tasks. The script defines a function `Llm()` that captures the content of the current buffer in Vim, constructs a JSON payload with specific parameters for text generation, and sends this payload to a server endpoint using a curl command. The server's response, which contains the generated text, is then inserted back into the buffer at the current cursor position. The script also maps the function to a Vim command `:Llm` and binds it to the F2 key for easy access. This plugin is intended to enhance the text editing capabilities of Vim by integrating external text generation services.
# Functions

---
### Llm
The `Llm` function sends the current buffer content to a local server for text completion and inserts the response back into the buffer.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Define the URL for the local server endpoint for text completion.
    - Retrieve the entire content of the current buffer and join it into a single string with newline separators.
    - Create a JSON payload with specific parameters for text completion and include the buffer content as the prompt.
    - Construct a curl command to send a POST request with the JSON payload to the server endpoint.
    - Execute the curl command and capture the server's response.
    - Decode the JSON response to extract the 'content' field.
    - Split the response content by newlines to prepare for insertion.
    - Insert the response content into the buffer at the current cursor position.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the current buffer by inserting the server's response at the cursor position.
