## Files
- **[CMakeLists.txt](eval-callback/CMakeLists.txt.driver.md)**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file in `llama.cpp/examples/eval-callback` configures the build and installation of the `llama-eval-callback` executable, links necessary libraries, sets C++ standard requirements, and defines a test for the executable.
- **[eval-callback.cpp](eval-callback/eval-callback.cpp.driver.md)**: The `eval-callback.cpp` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase implements a callback mechanism for evaluating tensor operations during graph execution, including functions for tensor data retrieval and logging.
- **[README.md](eval-callback/README.md.driver.md)**: The `README.md` file in `llama.cpp/examples/eval-callback` provides a simple example demonstrating the use of callbacks during inference, including a command-line usage example and expected console output detailing operations and tensor data.
