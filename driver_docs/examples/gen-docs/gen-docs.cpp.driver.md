# Purpose
This C++ source code file is designed to generate markdown documentation for command-line arguments used in a software application. The code reads argument definitions and their explanations, then formats this information into a markdown table, which is subsequently written to a file. The primary technical components include functions for writing table headers and entries, as well as a function to export the markdown file. The code utilizes structures like `common_arg` and `common_params` to manage argument data, and it processes these arguments to categorize them into common, sampling, and example-specific parameters. The [`export_md`](#export_md) function is central to this process, as it orchestrates the creation of markdown files by calling helper functions to format and write the argument data.

The file serves as an executable, as indicated by the presence of the [`main`](#main) function, which is responsible for initiating the markdown export process. It calls the [`export_md`](#export_md) function twice to generate two separate markdown files, `autogen-main.md` and `autogen-server.md`, each corresponding to different examples or use cases defined by `LLAMA_EXAMPLE_MAIN` and `LLAMA_EXAMPLE_SERVER`. This code provides a narrow functionality focused on documentation generation, specifically for command-line argument usage, and does not define public APIs or external interfaces. Instead, it operates as a standalone utility within a larger software project to facilitate the creation of user-friendly documentation.

# Functions

---
### write\_table\_header<!-- {{#callable:write_table_header}} -->
The `write_table_header` function writes a markdown table header to a given output file stream.
- **Inputs**:
    - `file`: A reference to an `std::ofstream` object where the table header will be written.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function writes a markdown table header to the provided file stream, consisting of two lines: one for the column names and one for the column separators.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it writes directly to the provided file stream.


---
### write\_table\_entry<!-- {{#callable:write_table_entry}} -->
The `write_table_entry` function formats and writes a table entry in markdown format to a file, based on the provided command-line argument options.
- **Inputs**:
    - `file`: A reference to an output file stream (`std::ofstream`) where the markdown table entry will be written.
    - `opt`: A `common_arg` object containing command-line argument details such as arguments, value hints, and help text.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Begin writing a table entry by outputting a markdown table cell with a backtick (`| `).
    - Iterate over each argument in `opt.args`, writing each argument to the file, separated by commas if there are multiple arguments.
    - Check if `opt.value_hint` is present; if so, escape any pipe characters and append it to the file.
    - Check if `opt.value_hint_2` is present; if so, escape any pipe characters and append it to the file.
    - Escape newline and pipe characters in `opt.help` and append it to the file, completing the markdown table row.
- **Output**: The function writes a formatted markdown table entry to the provided file stream, representing the command-line argument details.


---
### write\_table<!-- {{#callable:write_table}} -->
The `write_table` function writes a formatted table of command-line arguments and their explanations to a file.
- **Inputs**:
    - `file`: A reference to an output file stream (`std::ofstream`) where the table will be written.
    - `opts`: A vector of pointers to `common_arg` objects, each representing a command-line argument with its associated data.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call the [`write_table_header`](#write_table_header) function to write the table header to the file.
    - Iterate over each `common_arg` pointer in the `opts` vector.
    - For each `common_arg`, call the [`write_table_entry`](#write_table_entry) function to write a table entry for that argument to the file.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it writes directly to the provided file stream.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`write_table_header`](#write_table_header)
    - [`write_table_entry`](#write_table_entry)


---
### export\_md<!-- {{#callable:export_md}} -->
The `export_md` function generates a markdown file containing categorized parameter tables for a given example.
- **Inputs**:
    - `fname`: A string representing the name of the file to which the markdown content will be written.
    - `ex`: An instance of `llama_example` that specifies the example context for which parameters are being documented.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Open a file stream for the specified filename with truncation mode.
    - Initialize common parameters and parse them with the given example to obtain context arguments.
    - Iterate over the options in the context arguments to categorize them into common, sampling, and example-specific options based on their properties.
    - Write the categorized options into the file as markdown tables under respective headings: 'Common params', 'Sampling params', and 'Example-specific params'.
- **Output**: The function outputs a markdown file with tables of parameters categorized into common, sampling, and example-specific sections.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`common_params_parser_init`](../../common/arg.cpp.driver.md#common_params_parser_init)
    - [`write_table`](#write_table)


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function generates markdown documentation files for two different examples by calling the [`export_md`](#export_md) function with specific filenames and example identifiers.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function `main` is called with two parameters, which are not used within the function body.
    - The function calls [`export_md`](#export_md) twice, first with the filename 'autogen-main.md' and the example identifier `LLAMA_EXAMPLE_MAIN`, and second with the filename 'autogen-server.md' and the example identifier `LLAMA_EXAMPLE_SERVER`.
    - The function returns 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, which is a standard convention indicating successful execution of the program.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`export_md`](#export_md)
