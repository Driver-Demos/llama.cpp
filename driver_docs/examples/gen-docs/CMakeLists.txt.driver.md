# Purpose
This CMake configuration file defines the build instructions for a target named `llama-gen-docs`. It specifies that an executable should be created from the `gen-docs.cpp` source file, links it with the `common`, `llama`, and thread libraries, and requires C++17 standard features. The executable is also set to be installed as a runtime target.
