# Purpose
The provided content is a documentation snippet for a sample application named "llama.swiftui," which demonstrates local inference of the llama.cpp model on an iPhone. This document serves as a guide for developers who wish to use this sample app as a foundation for more complex projects involving the llama.cpp model. It includes instructions for building the necessary XCFramework by executing a script from the llama.cpp project root, and details on how to integrate the framework into other projects using Xcode. Additionally, it provides links to further resources, such as a discussion for usage instructions and performance statistics, as well as a video demonstration to aid in understanding the app's functionality.
