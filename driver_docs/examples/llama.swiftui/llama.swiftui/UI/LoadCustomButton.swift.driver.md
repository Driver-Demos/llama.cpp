# Purpose
The provided Swift code defines a SwiftUI view component named `LoadCustomButton`. This component is designed to facilitate the loading of custom models into an application, specifically models with the file extension ".gguf". The primary functionality of this component is to present a button labeled "Load Custom Model" that, when pressed, triggers a file importer interface allowing users to select a file from their system. The file importer is configured to accept only files of the specified type, ensuring that users can only select compatible model files.

The `LoadCustomButton` component is tightly integrated with an `ObservedObject` of type `LlamaState`, which is presumably responsible for managing the state and operations related to the model loading process. Upon successful file selection, the component attempts to load the model using the `loadModel` method of the `LlamaState` object. The code handles potential errors during this process by printing error messages to the console, ensuring that any issues encountered during model loading are logged for debugging purposes.

This code is a focused implementation within a larger application, likely part of a user interface that deals with model management or customization. It does not define a public API or external interface but rather serves as a user-facing component that interacts with the application's internal state management system. The use of SwiftUI and the file importer functionality highlights its role in providing a seamless and interactive user experience for model loading tasks.

# Data Structures

### LoadCustomButton
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `llamaState`: An observed object of type LlamaState that manages the state of the view.
    - `showFileImporter`: A state variable that controls the visibility of the file importer.
    - `init(llamaState:)`: Initializer that sets the llamaState property.
    - `body`: Defines the view's layout and behavior, including a button to load a custom model.
- **Description**: The LoadCustomButton is a SwiftUI view structure that provides a user interface for loading custom models into the application. It contains an observed object, llamaState, which is responsible for managing the state related to the model loading process. The view includes a button that, when pressed, presents a file importer allowing users to select a file with a specific extension (.gguf). The selected file is then processed to load the model into the application, with error handling for any issues that arise during the file access or model loading process.
