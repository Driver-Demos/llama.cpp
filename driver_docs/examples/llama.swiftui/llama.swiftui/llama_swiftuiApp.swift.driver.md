# Purpose
This Swift code defines the main entry point for a SwiftUI application named `llama_swiftuiApp`. It provides narrow functionality as it primarily sets up the application's main user interface window. The code specifies that the `ContentView` is the initial view to be displayed within the application's main window, encapsulated in a `WindowGroup`. As a SwiftUI application file, it leverages the `@main` attribute to indicate that this is the starting point of the app, making it an executable file rather than a library or configuration file.

### llama\_swiftuiApp
- **Type**: `SwiftUI App`
- **Members**:
    - `body`: Defines the main scene of the app, which contains the user interface.
- **Description**: The `llama_swiftuiApp` is a SwiftUI application structure that serves as the entry point for the app. It conforms to the `App` protocol, which requires the implementation of a `body` property. This property returns a `Scene`, specifically a `WindowGroup`, which is a container for the app's user interface. The `WindowGroup` hosts the `ContentView`, which is the root view of the app's UI. This structure is essential for setting up the app's main window and its initial content.
