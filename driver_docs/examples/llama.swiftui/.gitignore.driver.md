# Purpose
The file contents list directories typically found in an Xcode project structure. "xcuserdata" contains user-specific data such as workspace settings, while "xcshareddata" holds shared project settings and schemes. This configuration is used to manage and organize user-specific and shared data within an Xcode project.
