# Purpose
This CMake configuration file defines the build process for an executable named "llama-speculative" from the source file "speculative.cpp". It specifies that the executable should be installed as a runtime target and links it with the "common", "llama", and thread libraries. Additionally, it enforces the use of C++17 standard features during compilation.
