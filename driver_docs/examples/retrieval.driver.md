## Files
- **[CMakeLists.txt](retrieval/CMakeLists.txt.driver.md)**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file in `llama.cpp/examples/retrieval` configures the build process for the `llama-retrieval` executable, specifying source files, installation, library linking, and C++ standard requirements.
- **[README.md](retrieval/README.md.driver.md)**: The `README.md` file in `llama.cpp/examples/retrieval` provides instructions for using a retrieval example based on cosine similarity, detailing parameters and usage for the `retrieval.cpp` tool.
- **[retrieval.cpp](retrieval/retrieval.cpp.driver.md)**: The `retrieval.cpp` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase implements a system for chunking text files, processing them with a language model to generate embeddings, and then retrieving the most similar text chunks based on cosine similarity to a user-provided query.
