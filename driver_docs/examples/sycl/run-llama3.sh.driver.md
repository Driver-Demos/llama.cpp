# Purpose
This script is a Bash shell script designed to configure and execute a machine learning model using Intel's oneAPI toolkit. It sets up the environment by sourcing the `setvars.sh` script from the oneAPI installation directory, which likely configures necessary environment variables and paths for oneAPI tools. The script allows for the selection of a specific GPU device through the `ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR` environment variable, although this line is commented out by default. It defines several parameters, such as `INPUT_PROMPT`, `MODEL_FILE`, `NGL`, and `CONTEXT`, which are used to specify the input prompt, model file path, number of layers offloaded to the GPU, and context size, respectively. The script then checks for command-line arguments to determine whether to use a specific GPU device or multiple GPUs with the same maximum compute units, executing the `llama-cli` command with the specified parameters to run the model inference.
