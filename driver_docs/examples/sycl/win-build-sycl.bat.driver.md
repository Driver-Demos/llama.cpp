# Purpose
The provided file is a Windows batch script designed to automate the build process for a software project using Intel's oneAPI toolkit. It begins by checking for the existence of a "build" directory, creating it if necessary, and then navigates into this directory. The script sets up the environment by calling a batch file from the Intel oneAPI installation, ensuring the necessary environment variables and paths are configured. It includes commented-out instructions for configuring the build with different floating-point precision options (FP16 and FP32) using CMake, a cross-platform build system. The script then proceeds to build the project using the Ninja build system, handling errors by redirecting to an error-handling section if any command fails, and finally exits with the appropriate status code.
