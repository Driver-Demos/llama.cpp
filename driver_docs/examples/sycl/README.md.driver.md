# Purpose
The provided content is a documentation excerpt for an example program within the llama.cpp project, specifically designed to support SYCL on Intel GPUs. The document outlines the purpose and usage of a tool named `llama-ls-sycl-device`, which is used to list all available SYCL devices, providing details such as device ID, compute capability, and maximum work group size. The instructions guide users through building the llama.cpp project for a specified SYCL target, enabling the oneAPI environment if the target is set to Intel, and executing the tool to retrieve and display information about the SYCL devices. This documentation is essential for developers who need to identify and utilize specific SYCL devices in their computational tasks on Intel hardware.
