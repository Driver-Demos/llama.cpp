# Purpose
The provided script is a Bash shell script designed to configure and execute a machine learning model using Intel's oneAPI toolkit. It sets up the environment by exporting the `ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR` variable to specify the use of a Level Zero device and sources the `setvars.sh` script to initialize the oneAPI environment. The script is configured to run a model file, `llama-2-7b.Q4_0.gguf`, with a specific input prompt and context size, and it allows for the execution on either a single GPU or multiple GPUs, depending on the presence of command-line arguments. The script also includes optional debugging and system management settings, such as `GGML_SYCL_DEBUG` and `ZES_ENABLE_SYSMAN`, to facilitate GPU memory management and debugging during execution.
