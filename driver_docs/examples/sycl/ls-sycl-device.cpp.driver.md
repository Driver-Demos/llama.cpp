# Purpose
This code is a simple C++ executable, as indicated by the presence of the [`main`](#main) function, which serves as the entry point for execution. It provides narrow functionality, specifically designed to interact with the SYCL backend of the GGML library. The primary purpose of this code is to call the function `ggml_backend_sycl_print_sycl_devices()`, which likely enumerates and prints available SYCL devices, providing users with information about the SYCL-compatible hardware on their system. The inclusion of the header file "ggml-sycl.h" suggests that this code is part of a larger project or library that utilizes SYCL for parallel computing, and it is intended to be run as a standalone program to verify or display SYCL device information.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `ggml-sycl.h`


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function calls a function to print available SYCL devices and then exits.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function `ggml_backend_sycl_print_sycl_devices()` is called to print information about available SYCL devices.
    - The program returns 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful completion of the program.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`ggml_backend_sycl_print_sycl_devices`](../../ggml/src/ggml-sycl/ggml-sycl.cpp.driver.md#ggml_backend_sycl_print_sycl_devices)
