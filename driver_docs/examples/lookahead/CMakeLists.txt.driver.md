# Purpose
This CMake configuration file defines the build instructions for an executable named "llama-lookahead" from the source file "lookahead.cpp". It specifies the installation of the executable, links it with the "common" and "llama" libraries, as well as the CMake thread libraries, and enforces the use of the C++17 standard for compilation.
