## Files
- **[CMakeLists.txt](parallel/CMakeLists.txt.driver.md)**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file in `llama.cpp/examples/parallel` configures the build system to compile and install the `llama-parallel` executable with C++17 standard and links it with the `common`, `llama`, and threading libraries.
- **[parallel.cpp](parallel/parallel.cpp.driver.md)**: The `parallel.cpp` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase simulates a server handling multiple client requests in parallel, processing them with a language model and generating responses based on predefined prompts and questions.
- **[README.md](parallel/README.md.driver.md)**: The `README.md` file in `llama.cpp/examples/parallel` provides instructions and an example command for simulating parallel processing of client requests using the `llama-parallel` tool.
