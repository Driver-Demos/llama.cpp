# Purpose
The provided content is from a documentation file that explains the usage of a specific example script within the `llama.cpp` project, specifically the `eval-callback` example. This file serves to demonstrate how to implement and utilize a callback function during the inference process of a machine learning model, which is a narrow functionality focused on debugging and understanding model operations. The file includes a command-line usage example that specifies various parameters such as the model repository, model file, prompt, seed, and GPU layers to offload, which are crucial for executing the script correctly. The output section of the file provides detailed logs of the operations and tensor data during the model's inference, which is valuable for developers to trace and debug the model's behavior. This documentation is relevant to the codebase as it aids developers in understanding how to interact with the model inference process and interpret the detailed debug information provided by the callback.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a documentation snippet for a simple example script located in the `llama.cpp/examples/eval-callback` directory. This script demonstrates the use of a callback function during the inference process of a machine learning model. The primary function of this example is to print all operations and tensor data to the console, providing a detailed view of the model's internal workings during execution.

The usage section provides a command-line example of how to execute the script using the `llama-eval-callback` command. Key parameters include `--hf-repo` to specify the Hugging Face repository, `--hf-file` to indicate the model file, `--model` for the model name, `--prompt` for the input text, `--seed` for randomization control, and `-ngl` to specify the number of layers offloaded to the GPU.

The output section illustrates the type of information printed to the console, which includes details about the model's context, such as the number of layers offloaded to the GPU, buffer sizes, and graph nodes and splits. It also provides a series of debug outputs from the `ggml_debug` function, showing the transformations applied to the tensor data at various stages of the model's computation. These transformations include operations like normalization, matrix multiplication, addition, reshaping, and applying the rotary positional encoding (ROPE).

This documentation is crucial for developers who need to understand the internal operations of the model during inference, particularly those interested in debugging or optimizing the model's performance on GPU hardware. The detailed tensor data and operations provide insights into how the model processes input data and can be used to verify the correctness of the model's computations.
