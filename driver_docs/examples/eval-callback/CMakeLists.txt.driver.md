# Purpose
The provided content is a CMake configuration file used to define the build and test setup for a software project. It specifies the creation of an executable target named "llama-eval-callback" from the source file "eval-callback.cpp" and ensures that it is installed as a runtime component. The executable is linked with the libraries "common," "llama," and any necessary threading libraries, and it is compiled with C++17 standard features. Additionally, a test target named "test-eval-callback" is defined, which runs the "llama-eval-callback" executable with specific command-line arguments for testing purposes. The test is labeled with "eval-callback" and "curl" for categorization and identification within the testing framework.
