# Purpose
The provided content is an example script demonstrating the minimal usage of the `llama.cpp` library for text generation. It shows how to execute a command-line tool, `llama-simple`, with a specified model file (`ggml-model-f16.gguf`) and a text prompt ("Hello my name is") to generate text. The example includes parameters such as `n_len`, `n_ctx`, `n_parallel`, and `n_kv_req`, which configure the length of the generated text, context size, parallel processing threads, and key-value requests, respectively. The output illustrates the generated text and provides performance metrics, including the number of tokens decoded, the time taken for various stages of processing, and the speed of token generation. This example serves as a practical guide for users to understand how to utilize the `llama.cpp` library for efficient text generation tasks.
