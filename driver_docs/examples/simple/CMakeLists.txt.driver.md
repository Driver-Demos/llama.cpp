# Purpose
The file is a CMake configuration script used to define the build process for a C++ executable named "llama-simple." It specifies the source file "simple.cpp" for the executable, sets installation instructions for the runtime, links the executable with the "llama" library and thread libraries, and enforces the use of C++17 standard features during compilation.
