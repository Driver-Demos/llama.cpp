# Purpose
This C++ source code file is an executable program designed to load a machine learning model, process a text prompt, and generate text predictions based on the input. The program is structured around a command-line interface, allowing users to specify a model file, the number of tokens to predict, and the number of layers to offload to the GPU. The code begins by parsing command-line arguments to extract these parameters, ensuring that a valid model path is provided. It then loads the specified model using the `llama_model_load_from_file` function and initializes various components such as the vocabulary, context, and sampler necessary for text generation.

The core functionality of the program involves tokenizing the input prompt, initializing a context for the model, and iteratively generating new tokens using a sampling strategy. The program uses a loop to evaluate the model's predictions and sample the next token until the desired number of tokens is generated or an end-of-generation token is encountered. Throughout the process, the program provides performance metrics, such as the number of tokens decoded and the speed of generation. The code concludes by freeing allocated resources, including the sampler, context, and model, ensuring efficient memory management. This file is a standalone executable that leverages the "llama" library to perform text generation tasks, demonstrating a focused application of machine learning in natural language processing.

# Functions

---
### print\_usage<!-- {{#callable:print_usage}} -->
The `print_usage` function displays a usage message for the command-line application, showing the expected format and options for running the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `int`: An integer argument, which is not used in the function body.
    - `char ** argv`: An array of C-style strings representing the command-line arguments passed to the program, used to display the program name in the usage message.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by printing a newline followed by the text 'example usage:'.
    - It then prints another newline and a formatted string that includes the program name (from `argv[0]`) and the expected command-line options and arguments.
    - Finally, it prints another newline to conclude the usage message.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it outputs the usage message directly to the standard output using `printf`. 


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes and runs a text generation model using command-line arguments to configure the model path, number of tokens to predict, and GPU layers, then processes a prompt to generate and print text tokens.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of C-style strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize default values for model path, prompt, number of GPU layers, and number of tokens to predict.
    - Parse command-line arguments to set the model path, number of tokens to predict, and number of GPU layers, or print usage and exit if arguments are invalid.
    - Load dynamic backends for the model.
    - Initialize the model with specified parameters and load it from the file path provided.
    - Retrieve the vocabulary from the loaded model and tokenize the input prompt.
    - Initialize the context for the model with parameters including context size and batch size.
    - Initialize a sampler for token generation using a greedy strategy.
    - Print the tokenized prompt to the console.
    - Prepare a batch for the prompt tokens and enter the main loop for token generation.
    - In the main loop, decode the current batch, sample the next token, check for end of generation, and print the generated token.
    - Continue generating tokens until the specified number of tokens is reached or end of generation is detected.
    - Print performance metrics and clean up resources before exiting.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer status code, where 0 indicates successful execution and 1 indicates an error occurred during processing.
