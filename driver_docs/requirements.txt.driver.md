# Purpose
The provided content is from a requirements file typically used in Python projects to manage dependencies. This file specifies a list of other requirement files, each containing dependencies necessary for different top-level Python scripts within the llama.cpp project. The comments at the top indicate that this file should not directly include package names but should instead reference other files that list the required packages. This approach ensures that package versions remain compatible across all scripts, promoting consistency and reducing the risk of dependency conflicts. By organizing dependencies in this manner, the project maintains modularity and ease of maintenance, allowing developers to update or modify dependencies for specific scripts without affecting others.
