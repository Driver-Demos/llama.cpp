# Purpose
The provided content is a `pyproject.toml` file, which is a configuration file used by the Python packaging tool, Poetry. This file defines the metadata and dependencies for a Python project named "llama-cpp-scripts." It specifies the project's version, description, authors, and links to its homepage and repository. The file also lists the Python version and package dependencies required for the project, including `numpy`, `sentencepiece`, `transformers`, `protobuf`, and `torch`, with specific version constraints. Additionally, it includes development dependencies like `pytest` for testing purposes. The file configures a custom source for PyTorch CPU wheels and defines several command-line scripts that are part of the project, mapping script names to their respective Python entry points. The build system is specified to use `poetry-core` as the backend.
