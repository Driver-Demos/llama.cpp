# Purpose
This Python script is designed to process and transform Unicode data into a format suitable for use in C++ applications. It fetches the latest Unicode data from the Unicode Consortium's public repository and parses it to extract relevant information about Unicode code points, such as their categories, case mappings, and normalization forms. The script defines a function, [`unicode_data_iter`](#cpp/scripts/gen-unicode-dataunicode_data_iter), which iterates over the Unicode data, yielding tuples containing code point information. It then uses this data to populate several tables and arrays, including `codepoint_flags`, `table_whitespace`, `table_lowercase`, `table_uppercase`, and `table_nfd`, which store information about code point categories, whitespace characters, and case mappings.

The script also generates C++ code by outputting formatted data structures that represent the Unicode data in a way that can be directly used in C++ programs. It creates vectors and maps for Unicode ranges and mappings, such as `unicode_ranges_flags`, `unicode_set_whitespace`, `unicode_map_lowercase`, `unicode_map_uppercase`, and `unicode_ranges_nfd`. These structures are intended to be included in a C++ source file, `unicode-data.cpp`, which can be used to efficiently handle Unicode data in C++ applications. The script is a utility tool that bridges the gap between Unicode data and its application in C++ environments, providing a systematic way to handle Unicode properties and transformations.

# Functions

---
### unicode\_data\_iter<!-- {{#callable:llama.cpp/scripts/gen-unicode-data.unicode_data_iter}} -->
The `unicode_data_iter` function retrieves and parses Unicode data from a specified URL, yielding tuples containing codepoint information for each Unicode character.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function sends a GET request to the UNICODE_DATA_URL to retrieve Unicode data.
    - It checks the response status and decodes the content into a string format.
    - The function initializes an empty list `prev` to store previous codepoint data for range processing.
    - It iterates over each line of the Unicode data, splitting the line by semicolons to extract fields.
    - The function converts the first field to an integer `cpt` representing the codepoint, ensuring it is within the maximum allowed codepoints.
    - It extracts and converts the last two fields to integers `cpt_lower` and `cpt_upper`, representing lowercase and uppercase mappings, ensuring they are within the maximum allowed codepoints.
    - The function extracts the category `categ` and bidirectional `bidir` properties, ensuring they are of the correct length.
    - If the name field ends with ', First>', it stores the current codepoint data in `prev` and continues to the next iteration.
    - If the name field ends with ', Last>', it verifies that the previous data matches expected values and yields a range of codepoints from `prev[0]` to `cpt`.
    - For each line, it yields a tuple containing the codepoint, lowercase mapping, uppercase mapping, category, and bidirectional property.
- **Output**: The function yields tuples of the form (codepoint, lowercase mapping, uppercase mapping, category, bidirectional property) for each Unicode character or range of characters.


---
### out<!-- {{#callable:llama.cpp/scripts/gen-unicode-data.out}} -->
The `out` function prints a given line to the console, appending a newline character at the end.
- **Inputs**:
    - `line`: A string to be printed to the console, defaulting to an empty string if not provided.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses the built-in `print` function to output the `line` argument.
    - The `end` parameter of the `print` function is set to '\n', ensuring a newline is added after the printed line.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it outputs the given line to the console.
