# Purpose
This Bash script is designed to automatically generate and update an AUTHORS file, which typically lists contributors to a project. The script provides narrow functionality, focusing specifically on extracting and formatting author information from the project's Git history. It begins by writing a header with the current date and a note indicating that the file is auto-generated. The script then uses Git commands to retrieve a list of unique contributors, sorted by their commit history, and appends this information to the AUTHORS file. Additionally, it includes a placeholder for manually updating specific author names, demonstrating a simple way to customize the output. This script is intended to be executed as part of a project's maintenance or build process to keep contributor information up-to-date.
