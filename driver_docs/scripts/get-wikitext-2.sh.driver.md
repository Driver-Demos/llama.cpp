# Purpose
This Bash script is a utility script designed to automate the download and extraction of a specific dataset, "wikitext-2-raw-v1.zip," from a URL hosted on Hugging Face. It provides narrow functionality, focusing solely on retrieving and preparing this dataset for use. The script uses `wget` to download the file and `unzip` to extract its contents. Additionally, it includes a usage message that suggests how to use the dataset with a command-line tool called `llama-perplexity`, indicating that this script is likely part of a larger workflow involving language model evaluation or testing. The script concludes with an `exit 0` statement, signifying successful execution.
