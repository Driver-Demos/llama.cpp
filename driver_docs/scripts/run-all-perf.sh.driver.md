# Purpose
This Bash script is an executable file designed to automate the benchmarking of machine learning models using a tool called `llama-bench`. It provides a narrow functionality focused on running performance tests on specified models with various quantization levels and arguments. The script accepts a model name as a mandatory argument and optionally allows the user to specify quantization types and additional arguments. It constructs a command to execute the benchmarking tool with the specified parameters, ensuring that the results are stored in a designated output directory. The script includes error handling to ensure that it exits gracefully if required arguments are not provided or if any command fails during execution.
# Global Variables

---
### qnt
- **Type**: `array`
- **Description**: The variable `qnt` is an array that holds a list of quantization levels or types, such as 'f16', 'q8_0', 'q6_k', etc. These values represent different quantization schemes that can be applied to models.
- **Use**: This variable is used to construct model file paths for benchmarking, allowing the script to iterate over each quantization type and apply it to the specified model.


---
### args
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `args` variable is a global string variable that holds default command-line arguments for a script. It is initialized with the value "-ngl 999 -n 64 -p 512" and can be overridden by a third command-line argument if provided.
- **Use**: This variable is used to pass additional command-line options to the `llama-bench` executable.


---
### model
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `model` variable is a global string variable that stores the name of the model provided as the first command-line argument to the script. It is used to construct file paths and command-line arguments for subsequent operations in the script.
- **Use**: This variable is used to specify the model directory and file names for processing in the script.


---
### out
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `out` variable is a string that represents the path to a directory where results will be stored. It is constructed using a relative path that includes a temporary directory (`../tmp`) and a subdirectory named after the model specified by the user.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define the output directory for storing results generated by the script.


---
### mstr
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The variable `mstr` is a string that accumulates model file paths for different quantization levels. It is constructed by iterating over the `qnt` array and appending formatted file paths to the `mstr` string.
- **Use**: `mstr` is used to pass the constructed model file paths as arguments to the `llama-bench` command.
