# Purpose
This Python script is designed to automate the downloading of specific header files from various online repositories to a local directory structure. It provides narrow functionality, focusing solely on fetching and saving files from predefined URLs to specified local paths. The script uses the `urllib.request` module to retrieve files, iterating over a dictionary named `vendor` that maps URLs to their corresponding local file paths. Some entries in the dictionary are commented out, indicating that those files need to be synchronized manually. This script is a utility tool, likely used in a development environment to ensure that the latest versions of these dependencies are available locally, facilitating the integration of external libraries into a project.

- **Description**: The `vendor` variable is a dictionary that maps URLs of external library header files to their corresponding local file paths within a 'vendor' directory. It includes entries for libraries such as nlohmann/json, stb_image, miniaudio, and cpp-httplib. Some entries are commented out, indicating they require manual synchronization.
- **Use**: This variable is used to automate the downloading of specific library header files from the internet to local paths for use in a project.
