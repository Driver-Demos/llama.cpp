# Purpose
This Bash script, `ci-run.sh`, is designed to facilitate the execution of a continuous integration (CI) process by wrapping another script, `ci/run.sh`, within a specific directory structure. It provides a narrow functionality focused on managing temporary and cache directories to optimize disk usage, particularly when dealing with large model files. The script ensures that temporary files are stored in a specified `<tmp_dir>`, which can be a ramdisk to minimize SSD writes, and synchronizes persistent data with a `<cache_dir>`, defaulting to `~/.cache/llama.cpp`. It uses `rsync` to efficiently manage file synchronization between these directories, excluding certain file types, and then executes the main CI script within the prepared environment. This script is not an executable or a library but rather a utility script intended to be run directly to manage CI tasks in a specific project setup.
