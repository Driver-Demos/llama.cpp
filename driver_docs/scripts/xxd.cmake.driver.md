# Purpose
The provided CMake script is designed to convert a specified input file into a C-style header file containing a byte array representation of the file's contents. This is achieved by reading the input file, typically a binary or text file, and transforming its data into a hexadecimal sequence. The script then writes this sequence into an output header file, defining an unsigned char array and its corresponding length. This process is akin to the functionality of the `xxd -i` command, which is used to create C header files from binary data. The script is configured to be executed with CMake, requiring the user to specify the input and output file paths as command-line arguments.
