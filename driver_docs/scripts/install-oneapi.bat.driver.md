# Purpose
This code is a batch script designed to automate the download and installation of software components from a specified URL. It provides a narrow functionality focused on handling the installation process, including downloading an executable file using `curl`, executing it to extract contents, and running a bootstrapper to install the necessary components. The script allows for optional specification of components to be installed, and it manages integration with different versions of Visual Studio by setting specific parameters. It also includes error handling by capturing the exit code of the installation process and cleaning up temporary files and directories after execution. This script is likely intended to be executed in a Windows environment, as indicated by the use of batch script syntax and Windows-specific commands.
