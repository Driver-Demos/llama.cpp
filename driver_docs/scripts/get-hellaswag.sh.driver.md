# Purpose
This Bash script is a utility script designed to download a specific text file from a remote repository and provide usage instructions for a command-line tool named `llama-perplexity`. The script performs a narrow function, primarily focusing on fetching the `hellaswag_val_full.txt` file and then displaying guidance on how to use the `llama-perplexity` tool with this file. It is not an executable or a library but rather a helper script that simplifies the setup process for users by automating the download and providing clear instructions for subsequent steps. The script concludes with an `exit 0` statement, indicating successful execution.
