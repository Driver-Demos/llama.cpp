# Purpose
The provided script is a Bash shell script designed to copy files and directories from a source location to a target location within a software project. It uses the `cp` command with the `-rpv` flags, which stand for recursive, preserve file attributes, and verbose output, respectively. The script systematically copies CMake configuration files, source code files, header files, and test files from a directory named `../ggml` to a corresponding directory structure in the current working directory. Additionally, it copies a license file and a script for generating authors from the source to the target directory. This script is likely used to synchronize or update the local project files with the latest versions from a central or external repository, ensuring that the local development environment is up-to-date with the source code and configuration files.
