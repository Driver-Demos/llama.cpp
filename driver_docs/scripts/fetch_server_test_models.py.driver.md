# Purpose
This Python script is designed to automate the process of fetching models used in server tests, specifically targeting tests that are slow due to the size of the models involved. The script is intended to be executed from the root of a repository and is particularly useful for ensuring that model downloads do not cause test timeouts. It scans through test files located in a specific directory (`tools/server/tests/unit/`) to identify parameterized tests that specify models from the Hugging Face repository. The script uses the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) module to parse Python test files and extract model parameters, which are then used to fetch the models using a command-line interface tool (`llama-cli`).

The script defines a `HuggingFaceModel` class using Pydantic for data validation and immutability, ensuring that each model's repository and file information is correctly structured. It collects model parameters by parsing test files for specific decorators that indicate model usage. The script then constructs and executes shell commands to fetch each model, logging the process and handling errors gracefully. This script is a utility tool rather than a library, as it is meant to be run directly and does not define public APIs or external interfaces. Its primary function is to streamline the setup of test environments by pre-fetching necessary models, thereby optimizing the testing workflow.

# Classes

---
### HuggingFaceModel<!-- {{#class:llama.cpp/scripts/fetch_server_test_models.HuggingFaceModel}} -->
- **Members**:
    - `hf_repo`: The repository identifier for the Hugging Face model.
    - `hf_file`: The optional file name within the repository for the Hugging Face model.
- **Description**: The `HuggingFaceModel` class is a Pydantic model that represents a Hugging Face model configuration, including the repository and optional file name. It is designed to be immutable, as indicated by the frozen configuration in the nested `Config` class. This class is used to facilitate the fetching and management of models for server tests, ensuring that the correct models are downloaded and available for testing purposes.
- **Inherits From**:
    - `BaseModel`


---
### Config<!-- {{#class:llama.cpp/scripts/fetch_server_test_models.HuggingFaceModel.Config}} -->
- **Members**:
    - `frozen`: Indicates that the configuration is immutable.
- **Description**: The `Config` class is a simple configuration holder with a single class variable `frozen` set to `True`, indicating that the configuration is intended to be immutable.


# Functions

---
### collect\_hf\_model\_test\_parameters<!-- {{#callable:llama.cpp/scripts/fetch_server_test_models.collect_hf_model_test_parameters}} -->
The function `collect_hf_model_test_parameters` parses a test file to extract and yield HuggingFace model parameters from parameterized test decorators.
- **Inputs**:
    - `test_file`: A string representing the path to the test file to be parsed for HuggingFace model parameters.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Attempts to open and parse the provided test file into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
    - Logs an error and returns if the file cannot be opened or parsed.
    - Iterates over each node in the AST, checking for function definitions.
    - For each function definition, checks for decorators that are calls to a 'parametrize' attribute.
    - Extracts parameter names and values from the 'parametrize' decorator if 'hf_repo' is among the parameters.
    - Logs a warning and skips entries if parameter values are not in a list or tuples are not used for parameter values.
    - Yields a [`HuggingFaceModel`](#cpp/scripts/fetch_server_test_modelsHuggingFaceModel) instance for each valid set of parameters, extracting 'hf_repo' and optionally 'hf_file' from the parameter tuples.
- **Output**: Yields instances of [`HuggingFaceModel`](#cpp/scripts/fetch_server_test_modelsHuggingFaceModel) containing the 'hf_repo' and optionally 'hf_file' extracted from the test file's parameterized test decorators.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`llama.cpp/scripts/fetch_server_test_models.HuggingFaceModel`](#cpp/scripts/fetch_server_test_modelsHuggingFaceModel)
