# Purpose
This Bash script is a utility script designed to download a specific dataset file and provide usage instructions for a command-line tool. The script uses `wget` to fetch the "winogrande-debiased-eval.csv" file from a specified URL, indicating its role in setting up or preparing data for further processing. It then echoes usage instructions for a tool called `llama-perplexity`, suggesting that the script is part of a larger system or workflow involving language model evaluation, specifically with the Winogrande dataset. The script provides narrow functionality, focusing solely on downloading a file and displaying usage information, and it is not an executable or library but rather a helper script to facilitate a specific task in a broader process.
