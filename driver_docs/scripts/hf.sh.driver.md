# Purpose
This Bash script is designed to facilitate the downloading of models from the Hugging Face repository, providing a narrow but specific functionality. It acts as a command-line utility that can be executed to download model files by constructing the appropriate URL based on user input parameters such as `--url`, `--repo`, and `--file`. The script checks for the presence of either `curl` or `wget` to perform the download operation, ensuring compatibility with different system configurations. It includes error handling to verify the validity of the URL and provides usage instructions if the input parameters are incorrect or incomplete. Overall, this script serves as a utility tool to streamline the process of downloading Hugging Face models by automating URL construction and file retrieval.
# Global Variables

---
### cmd
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `cmd` variable is a string that holds the command template for downloading files using either `wget` or `curl`. It is dynamically assigned based on the availability of these commands on the system, with `wget` being preferred if both are available.
- **Use**: This variable is used to construct and execute the appropriate download command for a given URL, output directory, and file name.


---
### url
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `url` variable is a global string variable that stores the URL of a HuggingFace model to be downloaded. It is initially set to an empty string and is later assigned a value based on command-line arguments or constructed from the `repo` and `file` variables. The script ensures that the URL is valid and points to a HuggingFace model before attempting to download it.
- **Use**: The `url` variable is used to store and validate the URL of the HuggingFace model that the script will attempt to download.


---
### repo
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `repo` variable is a global string variable that stores the name of a repository on Hugging Face. It is used to construct the URL for downloading a specific file from the repository.
- **Use**: This variable is used to build the download URL when both the repository name and file name are provided as arguments.


---
### file
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `file` variable is a global string variable that is used to store the name of a file to be downloaded from a specified repository on Hugging Face. It is initially set to an empty string and is populated based on the command-line arguments provided to the script.
- **Use**: This variable is used to construct the URL for downloading a specific file from a Hugging Face repository when both `repo` and `file` are specified.


---
### outdir
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `outdir` variable is a global string variable that specifies the directory where downloaded files will be saved. It is initialized with a default value of ".", which represents the current directory.
- **Use**: This variable is used to determine the output directory for saving files downloaded from the specified URL.


---
### is\_url
- **Type**: `boolean`
- **Description**: The `is_url` variable is a boolean that indicates whether the provided URL is a valid HuggingFace model URL. It is initially set to `false` and is updated to `true` if the URL starts with 'https://huggingface.co'. This check ensures that the script only attempts to download from valid HuggingFace URLs.
- **Use**: The `is_url` variable is used to validate the URL format before proceeding with the download process.


---
### basename
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `basename` variable is a string that holds the base name of the file extracted from the URL. It is derived using the `basename` command, which strips the directory and suffix from filenames, leaving only the final component of the path.
- **Use**: This variable is used to specify the output file name when downloading a file from a URL, ensuring that the file is saved with its original name in the specified output directory.


# Functions

---
### log
The `log` function outputs messages to standard error (stderr).
- **Inputs**:
    - `$@`: A list of arguments to be logged, which can be any number of strings or variables.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses the `echo` command to print all arguments passed to it.
    - The output is redirected to file descriptor 2, which is standard error (stderr).
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it outputs the provided message to stderr.


---
### usage
The `usage` function logs the correct usage of the script and exits with an error code.
- **Inputs**:
    - `None`: The function does not take any input arguments directly.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls the `log` function to print the usage instructions to standard error.
    - The usage instructions include options for URL, repository, file, output directory, and help.
    - After logging the usage instructions, the function exits with a status code of 1, indicating an error.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it logs a message and exits the script with an error code.


---
### has\_cmd
The `has_cmd` function checks if a specified command is available in the system's PATH and is executable.
- **Inputs**:
    - `$1`: The name of the command to check for availability, such as 'curl' or 'wget'.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses the `command -v` command to check if the specified command is available in the system's PATH.
    - It checks if the command is executable by using the `-x` test flag.
    - If the command is not found or not executable, the function returns 1, indicating failure.
- **Output**: The function returns 1 if the specified command is not found or not executable; otherwise, it returns nothing, indicating success.
