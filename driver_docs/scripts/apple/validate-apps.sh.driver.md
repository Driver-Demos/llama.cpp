# Purpose
This Bash script serves as an executable file that sequentially runs a series of validation scripts for different Apple operating systems, including iOS, macOS, visionOS, and tvOS. The script provides narrow functionality, specifically focusing on executing validation processes for these platforms, likely as part of a larger build or deployment pipeline. By organizing the validation commands in a single script, it simplifies the process of ensuring that all necessary platform-specific checks are performed consistently. This script is intended to be executed directly, rather than imported or included in other scripts, and it acts as a convenient wrapper to streamline the validation workflow for developers working with multiple Apple operating systems.
