# Purpose
The `validate-macos.sh` script is a Bash script designed to automate the process of validating a macOS application that incorporates the `llama.xcframework` using SwiftUI. This script provides a narrow functionality focused on building, archiving, and validating a macOS application, with optional authentication through Apple ID credentials for enhanced validation processes. It is an executable script that sets up a temporary project structure, compiles the application, embeds the necessary framework, and performs a series of checks to ensure the app and its components are correctly built and packaged. The script also includes provisions for handling errors and offers guidance on using Apple Developer credentials for notarization, although it primarily performs basic validation checks without formal notarization.
# Global Variables

---
### APPLE\_ID
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: `APPLE_ID` is a global variable that stores the Apple ID email address used for authentication in the macOS application validation process. It is initialized with an empty string if not set via environment variables.
- **Use**: This variable is used to pass the Apple ID email for authentication when validating a macOS application.


---
### APPLE\_PASSWORD
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: `APPLE_PASSWORD` is a global variable that stores the app-specific password for an Apple ID, which is used for authentication purposes during the macOS application validation process. It is initialized with an empty string by default, but can be set via an environment variable or command line argument.
- **Use**: This variable is used to pass the app-specific password to authentication commands if provided, enabling the script to perform validation with Apple ID credentials.


---
### ROOT\_DIR
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `ROOT_DIR` variable is a string that holds the absolute path to the root directory of the project. It is determined by navigating two directories up from the directory containing the script (`validate-macos.sh`).
- **Use**: This variable is used as a base path for constructing other directory paths within the script, such as `BUILD_DIR`, `XCFRAMEWORK_PATH`, and others.


---
### BUILD\_DIR
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `BUILD_DIR` variable is a string that represents the path to the directory where the build artifacts for the macOS validation process are stored. It is constructed by appending '/validation-builds/ios' to the `ROOT_DIR`, which is the root directory of the project.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define the location for storing temporary and final build outputs, such as the app archive, app package, and validation results.


---
### APP\_NAME
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `APP_NAME` variable is a global string variable that holds the name of the macOS application being validated and built in the script. In this context, it is set to "MacOSLlamaTest".
- **Use**: This variable is used throughout the script to define paths and names for directories, files, and build artifacts related to the macOS application.


---
### BUNDLE\_ID
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `BUNDLE_ID` variable is a string that represents the unique identifier for the macOS application being validated. It is set to `org.ggml.MacOSLlamaTest`, which follows the reverse domain name notation commonly used for bundle identifiers in macOS applications.
- **Use**: This variable is used to specify the `CFBundleIdentifier` in the application's Info.plist file, which is essential for identifying the app within the macOS ecosystem.


---
### XCFRAMEWORK\_PATH
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `XCFRAMEWORK_PATH` variable is a string that holds the file path to the `llama.xcframework` directory within the project's build directory. This path is constructed by appending `/build-apple/llama.xcframework` to the `ROOT_DIR`, which represents the root directory of the project.
- **Use**: This variable is used to specify the location of the `llama.xcframework` so that it can be copied into the test project for building and validation purposes.


---
### TEMP\_DIR
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: `TEMP_DIR` is a global variable that holds the path to a temporary directory used during the macOS application validation process. It is defined as a subdirectory named 'temp' within the 'validation-builds/ios' directory under the root directory of the project.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store temporary files and directories needed for building and validating the macOS application, such as the test app project files and the copied XCFramework.


---
### ARCHIVE\_PATH
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: `ARCHIVE_PATH` is a global variable that holds the file path to the location where the macOS application archive will be stored after the build process. It is constructed by appending the application name with the `.xcarchive` extension to the `BUILD_DIR` path.
- **Use**: This variable is used to specify the destination path for the archived macOS application during the build and archive process.


---
### APP\_PATH
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: `APP_PATH` is a global variable that holds the file path to the built macOS application package (`.app`) for the test application named `MacOSLlamaTest`. It is constructed by appending the application name with the `.app` extension to the `BUILD_DIR` path, which is derived from the root directory of the project.
- **Use**: This variable is used to specify the location of the application package for further operations such as validation, packaging, and distribution.


---
### ZIP\_PATH
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: `ZIP_PATH` is a string variable that holds the path to the zip file created for the macOS application package. It is constructed by appending the application name with a `.zip` extension to the `BUILD_DIR` path.
- **Use**: This variable is used to specify the location where the zipped version of the macOS application will be stored for distribution or further processing.


---
### VALIDATION\_DIR
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `VALIDATION_DIR` variable is a global string variable that specifies the directory path where validation-related outputs and files are stored during the macOS application validation process. It is defined as a subdirectory named 'validation' within the 'validation-builds/ios' directory, which is itself a subdirectory of the `ROOT_DIR`. This directory is used to store outputs such as validation logs and results.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define the location where validation outputs are saved during the macOS app validation process.


# Functions

---
### print\_usage
The `print_usage` function displays usage instructions and options for the `validate-macos.sh` script.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by printing the usage command for the script: `Usage: ./validate-macos.sh [OPTIONS]`.
    - It then prints an empty line for better readability.
    - The function lists available options, including `--help`, `--apple-id EMAIL`, and `--apple-password PWD`, each with a brief description.
    - It prints another empty line to separate sections.
    - The function describes environment variables `APPLE_ID` and `APPLE_PASSWORD` that can be used for authentication.
    - Another empty line is printed for separation.
    - Finally, the function provides notes on the precedence of command line options over environment variables and the optional nature of authentication.
- **Output**: The function outputs a series of echo statements to the console, providing detailed usage instructions and options for the script.


---
### cleanup
The `cleanup` function is designed to handle errors by printing a failure message and exiting the script.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined without any parameters.
    - It prints the message '===== macOS Validation Process Failed ====='.
    - The function then exits the script with a status code of 1, indicating an error.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it exits the script with a status code of 1.
