# Purpose
The provided content is a segment from a Makefile, which is used to automate the build process of a software project. This particular section is responsible for determining the type and version of the C/C++ compiler being used, specifically distinguishing between GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) and Clang (a compiler front end for the C, C++, and Objective-C programming languages). It sets specific flags for the compiler based on its type and version to ensure compatibility and optimize the build process. For Clang, it checks if it is an LLVM or Apple variant and applies additional flags if certain version thresholds are met. Similarly, for GCC, it applies different flags based on the version to handle specific warnings and features. This configuration ensures that the code is compiled with the appropriate options for the detected compiler, enhancing code quality and preventing potential issues during compilation.
