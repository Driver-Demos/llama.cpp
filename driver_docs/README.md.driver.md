# Purpose
The provided content is from a README file, typically written in Markdown format, which serves as documentation for the `llama.cpp` project. This file provides comprehensive information about the software, including its purpose, installation instructions, usage examples, and development guidelines. The `llama.cpp` project is designed for running large language model (LLM) inference, specifically Meta's LLaMA model and others, using C/C++ with minimal setup. The README covers various aspects such as recent API changes, hot topics, supported models, and backends, as well as tools and infrastructure related to the project. It also includes sections for contributing to the project, dependencies, and additional resources for understanding the models and their limitations. This file is crucial for developers and users to understand how to effectively use and contribute to the `llama.cpp` project within a codebase.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a comprehensive documentation for the `llama.cpp` project, which is a C/C++ implementation designed for the inference of Meta's LLaMA model and other large language models (LLMs). The documentation outlines the project's primary goal of enabling efficient LLM inference with minimal setup across various hardware platforms, both locally and in the cloud. It highlights the project's dependency-free nature and its optimization for Apple silicon, x86 architectures, and NVIDIA GPUs, among others.

Key technical details include support for multiple quantization levels (from 1.5-bit to 8-bit) to enhance inference speed and reduce memory usage. The project also supports various backends like Metal, CUDA, Vulkan, and more, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of devices. The documentation provides a quick start guide for installation via package managers, Docker, or building from source, and it includes example commands for running models locally or via Hugging Face.

The document also details recent API changes, hot topics, and introduces new binaries and features such as multimodal support and a VS Code extension for FIM completions. It lists a wide array of supported models, both text-only and multimodal, and provides instructions for obtaining and quantizing models using the GGUF file format. Additionally, it covers various tools and utilities like `llama-cli`, `llama-server`, `llama-perplexity`, and `llama-bench` for different functionalities such as text completion, HTTP server setup, perplexity measurement, and performance benchmarking.

The documentation also includes sections on contributing to the project, supported bindings for various programming languages, and a list of UIs, tools, infrastructure, and games that integrate with `llama.cpp`. It concludes with information on dependencies, command-line completions, and the availability of an XCFramework for Swift projects. This extensive documentation serves as a vital resource for developers looking to leverage `llama.cpp` for LLM inference and development.
