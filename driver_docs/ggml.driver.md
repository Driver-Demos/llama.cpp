## Folders
- **[cmake](ggml/cmake.driver.md)**: The `cmake` folder in the `llama.cpp` codebase contains CMake scripts for setting compiler flags, configuring GGML library dependencies, and retrieving Git commit information.
- **[include](ggml/include.driver.md)**: The `include` folder in the `llama.cpp` codebase contains header files that define APIs, structures, and functions for managing various backend operations, memory allocation, and tensor computations across different hardware platforms using the GGML library.
- **[src](ggml/src.driver.md)**: The `src` folder in the `llama.cpp` codebase contains a comprehensive collection of source files and subdirectories dedicated to implementing and managing various computational backends and operations for the GGML library, including support for multiple platforms and architectures such as CPU, CUDA, OpenCL, and Vulkan, along with files for memory management, threading, quantization, and optimization of machine learning models.

## Files
- **[.gitignore](ggml/.gitignore.driver.md)**: The `.gitignore` file in the `llama.cpp/ggml` directory specifies that the `src/ggml-vulkan-shaders.hpp` and `src/ggml-vulkan-shaders.cpp` files should be ignored by Git.
- **[CMakeLists.txt](ggml/CMakeLists.txt.driver.md)**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `llama.cpp/ggml` directory configures the build system for the `ggml` project, setting up options for various backends, build types, and dependencies, while also managing installation and package configuration.
