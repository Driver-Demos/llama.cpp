# Purpose
This C++ source code file defines a comprehensive framework for handling grammar parsing and manipulation, specifically tailored for a system that appears to involve language processing or token parsing, as suggested by the inclusion of structures like `llama_vocab` and `llama_token`. The file is not an executable but rather a library or module intended to be integrated into a larger system, providing a set of functionalities related to grammar rules and parsing. The core components include enumerations, structures, and functions that define and manipulate grammar elements, rules, and parsing processes. The `llama_grammar_element` and `llama_grammar_candidate` structures, along with the `llama_gretype` enumeration, are central to representing and categorizing different types of grammar elements, such as terminal and non-terminal symbols, character ranges, and alternates.

The file also defines a `llama_grammar_parser` class, which encapsulates methods for parsing grammar rules from a source string, managing symbol IDs, and adding rules to the grammar. This class, along with the `llama_grammar` structure, provides a robust interface for grammar parsing, including support for lazy grammars that activate upon specific trigger patterns or tokens. The file includes internal API functions for initializing, cloning, and freeing grammar structures, as well as applying and accepting tokens within a grammar context. Overall, this code provides a specialized and detailed implementation for grammar handling, likely intended for use in a language processing or compiler-like environment where grammar rules and parsing are critical.

    - `LLAMA_GRETYPE_RULE_REF`: Represents a non-terminal element that references a rule.
    - `LLAMA_GRETYPE_CHAR`: Represents a terminal element, specifically a character or code point.
    - `LLAMA_GRETYPE_CHAR_NOT`: Represents an inverse character set, such as [^a], [^a-b], or [^abc].
    - `LLAMA_GRETYPE_CHAR_RNG_UPPER`: Modifies a preceding character to define an inclusive range, like [a-z].

    - `LLAMA_GRETYPE_CHAR_ANY`: Represents any character, denoted by a dot (.).
- **Description**: The `llama_gretype` enum defines various types of grammar elements used in parsing rules, including terminal and non-terminal elements, character sets, and special character definitions. It provides a way to categorize different components of a grammar, such as rule references, character ranges, and alternates, which are essential for constructing and interpreting grammar rules in a structured manner.


---
### llama\_grammar\_element<!-- {{#data_structure:llama_grammar_element}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `type`: An enum of type `llama_gretype` that specifies the type of grammar element.
    - `value`: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing either a Unicode code point or a rule ID.
- **Description**: The `llama_grammar_element` struct is a fundamental component of a grammar system, representing individual elements within a grammar rule. Each element is characterized by a type, defined by the `llama_gretype` enum, which indicates the role or category of the element, such as a terminal or non-terminal symbol. The `value` field holds either a Unicode code point for terminal elements or a rule ID for non-terminal elements, allowing the struct to encapsulate both character data and references to other rules within the grammar.


---
### llama\_partial\_utf8<!-- {{#data_structure:llama_partial_utf8}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `value`: Bit value accumulated so far, unshifted.
    - `n_remain`: Number of bytes remaining; -1 indicates an invalid sequence.
- **Description**: The `llama_partial_utf8` structure is used to represent a partially constructed UTF-8 sequence. It contains a `value` field that holds the bit value accumulated so far, and an `n_remain` field that indicates the number of bytes remaining to complete the sequence. If `n_remain` is set to -1, it signifies that the sequence is invalid. This structure is useful in scenarios where UTF-8 sequences are being incrementally constructed or validated.

- **Description**: The `llama_grammar` struct is a complex data structure designed to manage and apply grammar rules within a system, potentially involving lazy evaluation triggered by specific tokens or patterns. It includes a vocabulary pointer, a set of grammar rules and stacks, and mechanisms for handling partially generated UTF-8 sequences. The struct supports lazy grammars, which wait for specific trigger tokens or patterns before constraining sampling, and it maintains buffers and flags to manage this behavior. This design allows for flexible grammar application, including the ability to force the printing of special tokens and handle complex trigger patterns.
