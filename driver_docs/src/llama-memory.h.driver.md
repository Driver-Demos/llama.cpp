# Purpose
This C++ source code file defines interfaces and structures for managing memory states in a batch processing context, specifically tailored for a system that appears to be related to large language models (LLMs). The file provides a structured approach to handling memory operations, such as key-value (KV) caching, which is crucial for efficient data processing in machine learning applications. The code is organized around several key components: `llama_memory_params`, which defines parameters for memory management; `llama_memory_status`, an enumeration for tracking the status of memory operations; and two primary interfaces, `llama_memory_state_i` and `llama_memory_i`, which define the methods for managing memory states and operations. These interfaces are designed to be implemented for different types of memory management strategies, such as unified state and iSWA (incremental Stochastic Weight Averaging).

The file is not an executable but rather a header file intended to be included in other parts of a software system. It defines public APIs for memory management, allowing for the initialization, updating, and manipulation of memory states. The use of virtual functions and unique pointers (`std::unique_ptr`) suggests a design that emphasizes polymorphism and resource management. The code also includes a placeholder for a `llama_kv_cache` structure, indicating a transitional phase in the API's development. Overall, this file provides a modular and extensible framework for handling memory in batch processing, which is essential for optimizing the performance of large-scale machine learning models.

# Data Structures

---
### llama\_memory\_params<!-- {{#data_structure:llama_memory_params}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `type_k`: Represents the type of the key in the key-value cache.
    - `type_v`: Represents the type of the value in the key-value cache.
    - `swa_full`: Indicates whether to use a full-size SWA (Stochastic Weight Averaging) cache.
- **Description**: The `llama_memory_params` struct is designed to configure memory parameters for a key-value cache system, specifically within the context of a larger memory management framework. It includes fields to specify the types of keys and values used in the cache, as well as a boolean flag to determine whether a full-size Stochastic Weight Averaging cache should be utilized. This struct is likely used to initialize or configure memory-related operations in a system that handles large language model (LLM) memory management.


---
### llama\_memory\_status<!-- {{#data_structure:llama_memory_status}} -->
- **Type**: `enum`
- **Members**:
    - `LLAMA_MEMORY_STATUS_SUCCESS`: Indicates that the memory operation was successful.
    - `LLAMA_MEMORY_STATUS_NO_UPDATE`: Indicates that there was no update to the memory state.
    - `LLAMA_MEMORY_STATUS_FAILED_PREPARE`: Indicates that the memory preparation failed.
    - `LLAMA_MEMORY_STATUS_FAILED_COMPUTE`: Indicates that the memory computation failed.
- **Description**: The `llama_memory_status` enum defines a set of constants representing the status of memory operations within the llama system. It is used to indicate the success or failure of memory-related tasks, such as preparation and computation, and to check if any updates have been applied to the memory state. This enum is crucial for error handling and ensuring the correct execution of memory operations in the llama framework.


---
### llama\_memory\_state\_i<!-- {{#data_structure:llama_memory_state_i}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `~llama_memory_state_i`: Destructor for the interface.
    - `next`: Advances to the next ubatch and returns false if there are no more ubatches.
    - `apply`: Applies the current ubatch's memory state to the memory object and returns false on failure.
    - `out_ids`: Returns a reference to a vector of output IDs for the current ubatch.
    - `get_ubatch`: Returns a constant reference to the current ubatch.
    - `get_status`: Returns the status of the memory state for error handling and update checks.
- **Description**: The `llama_memory_state_i` struct is an interface for managing memory states during batch processing in a system that handles large language model (LLM) memory. It defines virtual methods for navigating through ubatches, applying memory states, retrieving output IDs, accessing the current ubatch, and checking the status of the memory state. This interface is designed to be implemented by specific memory types, allowing for flexible handling of different memory management strategies in LLM systems.
- **Member Functions**:
    - [`llama_memory_state_i::~llama_memory_state_i`](#llama_memory_state_illama_memory_state_i)

**Methods**

---
#### llama\_memory\_state\_i::\~llama\_memory\_state\_i<!-- {{#callable:llama_memory_state_i::~llama_memory_state_i}} -->
The destructor `~llama_memory_state_i` is a virtual default destructor for the `llama_memory_state_i` interface, ensuring proper cleanup of derived class objects.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The destructor is declared as virtual to ensure that the destructor of the derived class is called when an object is deleted through a pointer to the base class.
    - The destructor is defined as default, indicating that the compiler should generate the default implementation, which is typically a no-op for interfaces.
- **Output**: There is no output from this destructor; it is used for cleanup when an object is destroyed.

### llama\_memory\_i<!-- {{#data_structure:llama_memory_i}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Description**: The `llama_memory_i` struct is an abstract interface for managing memory states during batch processing in a large language model (LLM) context. It provides virtual methods for initializing batches, simulating full cache scenarios, and preparing for memory updates. Additionally, it includes operations for sequence manipulation and methods for reading and writing memory states. This interface is designed to be implemented by specific memory types, such as key-value caches, and is crucial for handling memory efficiently in LLMs.
- **Member Functions**:
    - [`llama_memory_i::~llama_memory_i`](#llama_memory_illama_memory_i)

**Methods**

---
#### llama\_memory\_i::\~llama\_memory\_i<!-- {{#callable:llama_memory_i::~llama_memory_i}} -->
The `~llama_memory_i` function is a virtual destructor for the `llama_memory_i` interface, ensuring proper cleanup of derived class objects.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined as a virtual destructor, which means it is intended to be overridden by derived classes.
    - The destructor is marked as `default`, indicating that the compiler should generate the default implementation for it.
    - Being a virtual destructor, it ensures that the destructor of the derived class is called when an object is deleted through a pointer to the base class.
- **Output**: The function does not produce any output as it is a destructor.
- **See also**: [`llama_memory_i`](#llama_memory_i)  (Data Structure)



---
### llama\_kv\_cache<!-- {{#data_structure:llama_kv_cache}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Description**: The `llama_kv_cache` is a struct that inherits from `llama_memory_i`, serving as a specialized type of memory interface for managing key-value (KV) cache in a large language model (LLM) context. It is designed to handle memory operations specific to KV caching, such as initializing batches, simulating full cache scenarios, and preparing for memory updates. The struct is part of a broader memory management system that includes various memory types and operations, although it currently does not define any additional members or fields beyond those inherited from `llama_memory_i`. The `llama_kv_cache` is marked for potential removal from the public API, indicating it may be a temporary or transitional component in the system.
- **Member Functions**:
    - [`llama_kv_cache::~llama_kv_cache`](#llama_kv_cachellama_kv_cache)
- **Inherits From**:
    - [`llama_memory_i`](#llama_memory_i)

**Methods**

---
#### llama\_kv\_cache::\~llama\_kv\_cache<!-- {{#callable:llama_kv_cache::~llama_kv_cache}} -->
The `~llama_kv_cache` function is a virtual destructor for the `llama_kv_cache` struct, ensuring proper cleanup of resources when an object of this type is destroyed.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined as a virtual destructor, which means it is intended to be overridden by derived classes if necessary.
    - The destructor is marked as `default`, indicating that the compiler will generate the default implementation for it.
    - Being a virtual destructor, it ensures that the destructor of any derived class is called when an object is deleted through a pointer to the base class `llama_memory_i`.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value as it is a destructor.
