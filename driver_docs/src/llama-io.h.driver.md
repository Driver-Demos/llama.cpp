# Purpose
This C++ header file defines two abstract classes, [`llama_io_write_i`](#llama_io_write_illama_io_write_i) and [`llama_io_read_i`](#llama_io_read_illama_io_read_i), which provide a narrow and specific interface for input/output operations. These classes are designed to be inherited by other classes that will implement the virtual functions for writing and reading data, respectively. The [`llama_io_write_i`](#llama_io_write_illama_io_write_i) class includes pure virtual methods for writing raw data and tensors, as well as a method to track the number of bytes written, while [`llama_io_read_i`](#llama_io_read_illama_io_read_i) includes methods for reading data and tracking bytes read. Both classes also provide non-virtual methods for handling strings, suggesting a focus on both binary and text data operations. This code is intended to be used as a base for creating custom I/O classes, making it a foundational component for a larger system that requires flexible data handling capabilities.

### llama\_io\_write\_i<!-- {{#data_structure:llama_io_write_i}} -->
- **Type**: `class`
- **Description**: The `llama_io_write_i` class is an abstract interface for writing data, providing virtual methods for writing raw data and tensors, as well as a method for writing strings. It includes a pure virtual function `write` for writing a specified number of bytes from a source, `write_tensor` for writing tensor data with an offset and size, and `n_bytes` to retrieve the number of bytes written so far. The `write_string` method is implemented to write a string by first writing its size followed by its data. This class is designed to be inherited by concrete classes that implement the actual writing logic.
- **Member Functions**:
    - [`llama_io_write_i::llama_io_write_i`](#llama_io_write_illama_io_write_i)
    - [`llama_io_write_i::~llama_io_write_i`](#llama_io_write_illama_io_write_i)
    - [`llama_io_write_i::write_string`](llama-io.cpp.driver.md#llama_io_write_iwrite_string)

**Methods**

---
#### llama\_io\_write\_i::llama\_io\_write\_i<!-- {{#callable:llama_io_write_i::llama_io_write_i}} -->
The `llama_io_write_i` constructor and destructor are default implementations for initializing and cleaning up instances of the `llama_io_write_i` class.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The constructor `llama_io_write_i()` is defined as default, meaning it performs no special initialization beyond what is automatically done by the compiler.
    - The destructor `~llama_io_write_i()` is also defined as default, indicating no special cleanup is required beyond the default actions taken by the compiler.
- **Output**: There is no output from the constructor and destructor as they are default implementations.
- **See also**: [`llama_io_write_i`](#llama_io_write_i)  (Data Structure)


---
#### llama\_io\_write\_i::\~llama\_io\_write\_i<!-- {{#callable:llama_io_write_i::~llama_io_write_i}} -->
The destructor `~llama_io_write_i` is a virtual default destructor for the `llama_io_write_i` class, ensuring proper cleanup in derived classes.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The destructor is declared as virtual to allow derived class destructors to be called correctly when an object is deleted through a base class pointer.
    - The destructor is defined as default, indicating that the compiler should generate the default implementation, which is typically a no-op unless the class manages resources.
- **Output**: There is no output from the destructor itself; it ensures proper resource cleanup when an object of a derived class is destroyed.

### llama\_io\_read\_i<!-- {{#data_structure:llama_io_read_i}} -->
- **Type**: `class`
- **Description**: The `llama_io_read_i` class is an abstract interface for reading operations, providing virtual methods for reading data of a specified size, reading data into a destination buffer, and retrieving the number of bytes read so far. It also includes a concrete method for reading a string, which reads a size-prefixed string from the input source. This class is designed to be inherited by concrete classes that implement the specific reading logic.
- **Member Functions**:
    - [`llama_io_read_i::llama_io_read_i`](#llama_io_read_illama_io_read_i)
    - [`llama_io_read_i::~llama_io_read_i`](#llama_io_read_illama_io_read_i)
    - [`llama_io_read_i::read_string`](llama-io.cpp.driver.md#llama_io_read_iread_string)

**Methods**

---
#### llama\_io\_read\_i::llama\_io\_read\_i<!-- {{#callable:llama_io_read_i::llama_io_read_i}} -->
The `llama_io_read_i` constructor and destructor are default implementations for initializing and cleaning up instances of the `llama_io_read_i` class.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The constructor `llama_io_read_i()` is defined as default, meaning it performs no special initialization beyond what is automatically done by the compiler.
    - The destructor `~llama_io_read_i()` is also defined as default, indicating no special cleanup is required beyond the default actions taken by the compiler.
- **Output**: There is no output from the constructor and destructor as they are default implementations.
- **See also**: [`llama_io_read_i`](#llama_io_read_i)  (Data Structure)


---
#### llama\_io\_read\_i::\~llama\_io\_read\_i<!-- {{#callable:llama_io_read_i::~llama_io_read_i}} -->
The `~llama_io_read_i` function is a virtual destructor for the `llama_io_read_i` class, ensuring proper cleanup of derived class objects.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined as a virtual destructor, which means it is intended to be overridden by derived classes if necessary.
    - The function is marked as `default`, indicating that the compiler should generate the default implementation for the destructor.
    - Being a virtual destructor, it ensures that the destructor of the derived class is called when an object is deleted through a base class pointer.
- **Output**: The function does not produce any output as it is a destructor.
