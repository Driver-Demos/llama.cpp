# Purpose
The provided C++ code is a specialized library designed for handling Unicode data, focusing on character properties, transformations, and text normalization. It includes data structures and constants that represent Unicode character properties, such as `unicode_ranges_flags` for determining character categories and `unicode_set_whitespace` for identifying whitespace characters, which are useful for text processing tasks like tokenization. Additionally, the code offers mappings for converting characters between uppercase and lowercase, essential for case-insensitive text processing, and includes normalization form decomposition (NFD) mappings to convert characters into their canonical decomposed forms, crucial for consistent text representation in applications like search engines and databases. While the code does not define public APIs or external interfaces, it serves as a valuable resource for applications requiring Unicode-compliant text processing, providing a data source for character transformations and normalization within a larger text processing system.

# Global Variables

---
### unicode\_ranges\_flags
- **Type**: `const std::initializer_list<std::pair<uint32_t, uint16_t>>`
- **Description**: The `unicode_ranges_flags` is a global constant variable defined as an `initializer_list` of `std::pair` objects, where each pair consists of a `uint32_t` and a `uint16_t`. This list represents a series of Unicode ranges, with each pair indicating the start of a Unicode range and associated flags for that range.
- **Use**: This variable is used to map Unicode ranges to specific flags, which can be used for categorizing or processing Unicode characters based on their range.


---
### unicode\_set\_whitespace
- **Type**: `std::unordered_set<uint32_t>`
- **Description**: The `unicode_set_whitespace` is a constant unordered set of 32-bit unsigned integers representing Unicode code points that correspond to various whitespace characters. This set includes common whitespace characters such as space, tab, and newline, as well as less common ones like the non-breaking space and other Unicode-defined whitespace characters.
- **Use**: This variable is used to efficiently check if a given Unicode code point is a whitespace character by determining its presence in the set.


---
### unicode\_map\_lowercase
- **Type**: `std::initializer_list<std::pair<uint32_t, uint32_t>>`
- **Description**: The `unicode_map_lowercase` is a constant global variable that holds an initializer list of pairs of 32-bit unsigned integers. Each pair represents a mapping from an uppercase Unicode code point to its corresponding lowercase Unicode code point.
- **Use**: This variable is used to convert uppercase Unicode characters to their lowercase equivalents by providing a direct mapping between their code points.


---
### unicode\_map\_uppercase
- **Type**: `std::initializer_list<std::pair<uint32_t, uint32_t>>`
- **Description**: The `unicode_map_uppercase` is a constant global variable that holds an initializer list of pairs, where each pair consists of two `uint32_t` values. These pairs map Unicode code points of lowercase characters to their corresponding uppercase characters.
- **Use**: This variable is used to convert lowercase Unicode characters to their uppercase equivalents by providing a mapping between their code points.


---
### unicode\_ranges\_nfd
- **Type**: `std::initializer_list<range_nfd>`
- **Description**: The `unicode_ranges_nfd` is a constant global variable of type `std::initializer_list<range_nfd>`, which is a list of `range_nfd` structures. Each `range_nfd` structure contains three hexadecimal values representing a range of Unicode code points and their corresponding Normalization Form D (NFD) mapping. This list is used to define specific Unicode ranges and their decomposed forms.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and provide access to predefined Unicode ranges and their NFD mappings for text normalization processes.
