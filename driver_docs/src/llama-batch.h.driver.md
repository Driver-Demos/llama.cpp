# Purpose
This C++ source code file defines several structures and functions related to handling batches of sequences, particularly in the context of machine learning or data processing tasks involving sequences of tokens. The primary focus of the code is on managing and manipulating batches of sequences, with an emphasis on metadata and sequence length awareness. The code introduces structures such as `llama_ubatch`, [`llama_sbatch`](#llama_sbatchllama_sbatch), and `llama_batch_allocr`, each serving specific roles in the batch processing workflow. The `llama_ubatch` structure is an enhanced version of a batch that includes additional metadata about sequences, while [`llama_sbatch`](#llama_sbatchllama_sbatch) is designed for sequence-length-aware batch splitting, providing methods to split sequences into batches of equal or unequal lengths. The `llama_batch_allocr` structure is used for temporary memory allocation for input batches, ensuring that the necessary data structures are in place for processing.

The code is organized around the theme of batch processing, with a focus on efficiently handling sequences of tokens. It provides a collection of components that work together to facilitate the splitting and management of sequence batches, which is crucial for tasks that require processing large datasets in a structured manner. The use of vectors and arrays indicates a dynamic approach to handling varying sequence lengths and batch sizes. The file is likely part of a larger library or application, as it includes headers and structures that suggest integration with other components, such as `llama.h`. The presence of TODO comments indicates areas for potential improvement or refactoring, particularly in the handling of sequence IDs and the reworking of certain data structures. Overall, this code provides specialized functionality for sequence batch processing, making it a valuable component in applications dealing with tokenized data sequences.

### llama\_sbatch<!-- {{#data_structure:llama_sbatch}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `n_tokens`: Represents the number of tokens left in the batch.
    - `n_embd`: Stores the number of embeddings.
    - `logits_all`: Indicates whether all logits are considered, with a note for future removal.
    - `ids`: A vector of sorted indices into the batch.

- **Description**: The `llama_sbatch` struct is designed for sequence-length-aware batch processing, providing metadata about sequences and facilitating batch operations such as splitting and reserving ubatches. It includes fields for managing tokens, embeddings, and sequence indices, and it supports operations to handle sequences of varying lengths. The struct is closely tied to the `llama_batch` structure and includes a nested `ubatch_data` struct for managing ubatch-specific data. The design indicates a focus on efficient batch processing with considerations for future improvements and rework.

**Methods**

#### llama\_sbatch::llama\_sbatch<!-- {{#callable:llama_sbatch::llama_sbatch}} -->
The `llama_sbatch` constructor initializes a `llama_sbatch` object with a given batch, embedding size, and optional flags for simple splitting and logits handling.
- **Inputs**:
    - `batch`: A constant reference to a `llama_batch` object that provides the initial batch data for the `llama_sbatch`.
    - `n_embd`: A size_t value representing the number of embeddings.
    - `simple_split`: A boolean flag indicating whether to use simple splitting for the batch sequences; defaults to false.
    - `logits_all`: A boolean flag indicating whether to handle logits for all sequences; defaults to false.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The constructor initializes the `llama_sbatch` object with the provided `batch` and `n_embd` values.
    - It sets the `simple_split` and `logits_all` flags based on the provided arguments or their default values.
- **Output**: An initialized `llama_sbatch` object with the specified batch data, embedding size, and configuration flags.
