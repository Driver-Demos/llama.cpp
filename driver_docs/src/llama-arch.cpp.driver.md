# Purpose
This C++ source code file is a comprehensive mapping and utility module for handling various large language model (LLM) architectures and their associated components. It defines several static maps that associate architecture identifiers (`llm_arch`) and tensor identifiers (`llm_tensor`) with their corresponding string names and operational details. The file includes mappings for a wide range of LLM architectures, such as LLAMA, GPT-2, BERT, and many others, each associated with specific tensor names and operations. These mappings are crucial for identifying and working with different components of LLMs, facilitating operations like tensor manipulation and architecture-specific processing.

The file also defines utility functions and classes, such as [`LLM_KV`](#LLM_KVLLM_KV) and `LLM_TN_IMPL`, which provide mechanisms to format and retrieve architecture and tensor names dynamically. These utilities are essential for generating consistent and architecture-specific identifiers used throughout the LLM processing pipeline. The file serves as a foundational component in a larger system, likely intended to be imported and used by other parts of a software project dealing with LLMs. It does not define a public API or external interfaces directly but provides essential internal mappings and utilities that support the broader functionality of LLM handling and processing.

**Methods**

---
#### LLM\_KV::LLM\_KV<!-- {{#callable:LLM_KV::LLM_KV}} -->
The `LLM_KV` constructor initializes an instance of the `LLM_KV` struct with a specified architecture and optional suffix.
- **Inputs**:
    - `arch`: An `llm_arch` type representing the architecture of the LLM (Large Language Model).
    - `suffix`: A `const char*` representing an optional suffix for the LLM key-value pair, defaulting to `nullptr` if not provided.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The constructor initializes the `arch` member variable with the provided `arch` argument.
    - The constructor initializes the `suffix` member variable with the provided `suffix` argument.
- **Output**: The constructor does not return any value; it initializes the `LLM_KV` object.

---
#### LLM\_KV::operator\(\)<!-- {{#callable:LLM_KV::operator()}} -->
The `operator()` function in the `LLM_KV` struct formats and returns a string based on the provided `llm_kv` key, the architecture, and an optional suffix.
- **Inputs**:
    - `kv`: An `llm_kv` enumeration value representing a specific key-value pair to be formatted.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the `suffix` member variable is not null.
    - If `suffix` is not null, format the string using the `LLM_KV_NAMES` map for the `kv` key, the `LLM_ARCH_NAMES` map for the `arch` member, and the `suffix`.
    - If `suffix` is null, format the string using only the `LLM_KV_NAMES` map for the `kv` key and the `LLM_ARCH_NAMES` map for the `arch` member.
- **Output**: A formatted `std::string` based on the `kv` key, architecture, and optional suffix.

- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the tensor type exists in the `LLM_TENSOR_NAMES` map for the given architecture.
    - If the tensor type is not found, return the string "__missing__".
    - If the tensor type is found, format the tensor name using the corresponding format string from `LLM_TENSOR_NAMES`, substituting `bid` and `xid` as needed.
    - If `suffix` is not null, append a period and the suffix to the formatted tensor name.
