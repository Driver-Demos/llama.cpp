# Purpose
The provided content is a CMake configuration script used to define the build process for a software library named "llama." This script specifies the source files required to compile the "llama" library, which includes a variety of C++ source and header files. It sets up include directories for both private and public access, ensuring that the necessary headers are available during compilation. The script enforces the use of C++17 standards and links the "llama" library with another library called "ggml." Additionally, it includes conditional logic to handle shared library builds, setting properties for position-independent code and defining specific compile-time definitions when shared libraries are being built.
