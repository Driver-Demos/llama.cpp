# Purpose
This file is a simple C header file that uses the `#pragma once` directive to prevent multiple inclusions of the same header file within a single compilation. The `#pragma once` directive is a non-standard but widely supported preprocessor directive that serves the same purpose as traditional include guards, ensuring that the compiler includes the header file only once, even if it is referenced multiple times in different parts of the code. This helps to avoid potential issues such as redefinition errors and reduces compilation time. The file itself does not contain any declarations or definitions, indicating that it is likely intended to be expanded with additional content in the future.
