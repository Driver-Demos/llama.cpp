# Purpose
The provided code is a C++ header file, as indicated by the use of `#pragma once` for include guard purposes, and it defines structures and a function prototype related to a sampling mechanism, likely for a machine learning or natural language processing application involving "llama" models. The code offers narrow functionality, focusing specifically on defining a sampler chain and initializing a sampler for "dry testing," which suggests a testing phase without actual data processing. The `llama_sampler_chain` structure includes parameters and a vector of sampler pointers, along with timing-related mutable variables, indicating that it is designed to manage a sequence of sampling operations. The function `llama_sampler_init_dry_testing` is declared to initialize a sampler with specific parameters, such as context size and dry run settings, but its implementation is not provided in this snippet.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `llama.h`
- `vector`


# Global Variables

### llama\_sampler\_init\_dry\_testing
- **Type**: `struct llama_sampler *`
- **Description**: The `llama_sampler_init_dry_testing` is a function that initializes a `llama_sampler` structure for dry testing purposes. It takes several parameters including context size, dry multiplier, dry base, allowed length, penalty for the last N tokens, and a vector of sequence breakers. This function is likely used to set up a sampler with specific testing configurations without actual sampling.
- **Use**: This function is used to create and configure a `llama_sampler` instance for testing scenarios, allowing for controlled testing of sampling behavior with specified parameters.


# Data Structures

---
### llama\_sampler\_chain<!-- {{#data_structure:llama_sampler_chain}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `params`: Holds the parameters for the llama sampler chain.
    - `samplers`: A vector of pointers to llama_sampler structures.
    - `t_sample_us`: A mutable integer representing the timing in microseconds for sampling.
    - `n_sample`: A mutable integer representing the number of samples.
- **Description**: The `llama_sampler_chain` struct is designed to manage a sequence of llama samplers, encapsulating both the parameters and the collection of samplers themselves. It also includes mutable fields for tracking timing and the number of samples, which suggests its use in performance-sensitive contexts where sampling operations are timed and counted. This struct is likely part of a larger system for managing and executing sampling operations in a llama-based application.
