# Purpose
This code is a C++ header file, as indicated by the `#pragma once` directive, which is used to prevent multiple inclusions of the file. It provides narrow functionality related to Unicode character processing, specifically dealing with Unicode code points and their properties. The file defines a `struct` named `range_nfd` to represent a range of Unicode code points with their corresponding Normalization Form D (NFD) value. It also declares several external constant data structures, such as `unicode_ranges_flags`, `unicode_set_whitespace`, `unicode_map_lowercase`, `unicode_map_uppercase`, and `unicode_ranges_nfd`, which are likely defined elsewhere and are intended to be used for operations like identifying whitespace characters, converting characters to lowercase or uppercase, and handling Unicode normalization. The use of `std::initializer_list` and `std::unordered_set` suggests that these data structures are designed for efficient lookup and initialization, making this header file a utility for Unicode-related operations in a larger codebase.

# Global Variables

---
### MAX\_CODEPOINTS
- **Type**: ``uint32_t``
- **Description**: `MAX_CODEPOINTS` is a constant global variable of type `uint32_t` that represents the maximum number of Unicode code points, which is 0x110000 in hexadecimal or 1,114,112 in decimal. This value is derived from the Unicode standard, which defines the range of valid code points from 0 to 0x10FFFF.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define the upper limit for Unicode code points in the program, ensuring that operations involving Unicode characters adhere to the standard range.


---
### unicode\_ranges\_flags
- **Type**: `std::initializer_list<std::pair<uint32_t, uint16_t>>`
- **Description**: The `unicode_ranges_flags` is a global constant variable defined as an initializer list of pairs, where each pair consists of a 32-bit unsigned integer and a 16-bit unsigned integer. This structure is likely used to represent a range of Unicode code points and associated flags or properties.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and provide access to a predefined list of Unicode code point ranges along with their corresponding flags or properties.


---
### unicode\_set\_whitespace
- **Type**: `std::unordered_set<uint32_t>`
- **Description**: The `unicode_set_whitespace` is a global constant variable that represents a set of Unicode code points corresponding to whitespace characters. It is defined as an unordered set of 32-bit unsigned integers, which allows for efficient lookup operations to determine if a given code point is a whitespace character.
- **Use**: This variable is used to quickly check if a Unicode code point is classified as a whitespace character.


---
### unicode\_map\_lowercase
- **Type**: `std::initializer_list<std::pair<uint32_t, uint32_t>>`
- **Description**: The `unicode_map_lowercase` is a global constant variable that holds an initializer list of pairs, where each pair consists of two 32-bit unsigned integers. This list is used to map Unicode code points to their corresponding lowercase equivalents.
- **Use**: This variable is used to provide a mapping from Unicode code points to their lowercase counterparts, facilitating case conversion operations.


---
### unicode\_map\_uppercase
- **Type**: `std::initializer_list<std::pair<uint32_t, uint32_t>>`
- **Description**: The `unicode_map_uppercase` is a global constant variable that holds an initializer list of pairs, where each pair consists of two 32-bit unsigned integers. This list is likely used to map Unicode code points to their corresponding uppercase equivalents.
- **Use**: This variable is used to provide a mapping from Unicode code points to their uppercase counterparts, facilitating case conversion operations.


---
### unicode\_ranges\_nfd
- **Type**: `std::initializer_list<range_nfd>`
- **Description**: The `unicode_ranges_nfd` is a global constant variable that holds an initializer list of `range_nfd` structures. Each `range_nfd` structure contains three `uint32_t` members: `first`, `last`, and `nfd`, which likely represent a range of Unicode code points and their corresponding Normalization Form D (NFD) value.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and provide access to a predefined list of Unicode ranges and their NFD mappings for normalization processes.


# Data Structures

---
### range\_nfd<!-- {{#data_structure:range_nfd}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `first`: The starting code point of the Unicode range.
    - `last`: The ending code point of the Unicode range.
    - `nfd`: The Normalization Form D (NFD) value associated with the range.
- **Description**: The `range_nfd` struct is used to represent a range of Unicode code points along with their associated Normalization Form D (NFD) value. It contains three members: `first` and `last`, which define the inclusive range of code points, and `nfd`, which holds the NFD value for that range. This struct is likely used in the context of Unicode normalization processes to efficiently map ranges of code points to their normalized forms.
