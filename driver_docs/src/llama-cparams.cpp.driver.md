# Purpose
This code provides narrow functionality, specifically designed to return a constant value defined elsewhere, likely in the included header file "llama-cparams.h". It is a C++ source file that defines a single function, [`llama_max_parallel_sequences`](#llama_max_parallel_sequences), which returns the value of `LLAMA_MAX_PARALLEL_SEQUENCES`. This suggests that the code is part of a larger library or module, where `LLAMA_MAX_PARALLEL_SEQUENCES` is a constant that determines the maximum number of parallel sequences that can be handled, possibly in a parallel processing or computational context. The function serves as an accessor, encapsulating the constant's retrieval, which can be useful for maintaining modularity and abstraction in the codebase.

### llama\_max\_parallel\_sequences<!-- {{#callable:llama_max_parallel_sequences}} -->
The function `llama_max_parallel_sequences` returns the maximum number of parallel sequences allowed.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function directly returns the value of the constant `LLAMA_MAX_PARALLEL_SEQUENCES`.
- **Output**: The function returns a `size_t` value representing the maximum number of parallel sequences.
