# Purpose
This C++ header file provides a set of utility functions and macros primarily focused on logging and string manipulation, with additional support for performance measurement and tensor shape formatting. The file includes conditional compilation directives to ensure compatibility with different compilers, specifically handling format attribute specifications for GNU and MinGW compilers. The logging functionality is a central component, offering macros for various log levels (e.g., INFO, WARN, ERROR) that internally call a logging function, `llama_log_internal`, which is designed to handle formatted output based on the specified log level.

The file also defines a few utility structures and functions. The [`no_init`](#no_initno_init) template struct is a utility to create objects without initializing them, which can be useful in performance-critical sections where initialization is unnecessary. The `time_meas` struct is designed to measure elapsed time, likely for performance profiling, by accumulating time differences. String manipulation is facilitated by functions like `replace_all`, which replaces occurrences of a substring within a string, and `format`, which provides formatted string creation. Additionally, the file includes functions for formatting tensor shapes and converting key-value pairs to strings, indicating its use in contexts involving tensor operations, possibly in machine learning or numerical computing applications. Overall, this header file is intended to be included in other C++ source files, providing a cohesive set of utilities for logging, performance measurement, and string manipulation.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `ggml.h`
- `string`
- `vector`


# Data Structures

---
### no\_init<!-- {{#data_structure:no_init}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `value`: A templated member variable of type T that holds the value of the struct.
- **Description**: The `no_init` struct is a simple templated data structure designed to hold a single value of type T. It features a default constructor that performs no initialization, allowing for the creation of an instance without setting the value, which can be useful in scenarios where initialization is handled elsewhere or is unnecessary.
- **Member Functions**:
    - [`no_init::no_init`](#no_initno_init)

**Methods**

---
#### no\_init::no\_init<!-- {{#callable:no_init::no_init}} -->
The `no_init` constructor is a default constructor for the `no_init` struct that performs no initialization actions.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The constructor is defined within the `no_init` struct template, which takes a type parameter `T`.
    - The constructor body is empty, indicating that it performs no operations or initializations.
- **Output**: The constructor does not return any value, as it is a default constructor for the `no_init` struct.
- **See also**: [`no_init`](#no_init)  (Data Structure)

### time\_meas<!-- {{#data_structure:time_meas}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `t_start_us`: A constant integer representing the start time in microseconds.
    - `t_acc`: A reference to an integer that accumulates the elapsed time.
- **Description**: The `time_meas` struct is designed to measure and accumulate elapsed time in microseconds. It contains a constructor that initializes the start time and a reference to an accumulator variable, and a destructor that updates the accumulator with the elapsed time since the start, unless disabled. The `t_start_us` member holds the start time, while `t_acc` is a reference to an external variable that accumulates the total elapsed time.
- **Member Functions**:
    - [`time_meas::time_meas`](llama-impl.cpp.driver.md#time_meastime_meas)
    - [`time_meas::~time_meas`](llama-impl.cpp.driver.md#time_meastime_meas)
