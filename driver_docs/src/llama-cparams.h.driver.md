# Purpose
This C header file defines a structure, `llama_cparams`, which is used to configure parameters for a machine learning model, likely related to the "llama" project, as suggested by the inclusion of "llama.h". The structure contains various fields that specify configuration settings such as context size, batch sizes, thread counts, and several hyperparameters related to model inference and performance optimization. Additionally, it includes boolean flags for enabling or disabling specific features like embeddings, causal attention, and performance optimizations. The file also defines a callback function pointer, `cb_eval`, for scheduling evaluation tasks, which suggests that this configuration structure is used in a multi-threaded or parallel processing context. The use of `#pragma once` ensures the file is included only once in a single compilation, preventing duplicate definitions.
