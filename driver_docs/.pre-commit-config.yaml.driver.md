# Purpose
This file is a configuration for the pre-commit framework, which is used to manage and run pre-commit hooks in a codebase. It specifies repositories containing hooks to be used, such as `pre-commit-hooks` and `flake8`, and lists specific hooks like `trailing-whitespace`, `end-of-file-fixer`, `check-yaml`, `check-added-large-files`, and `flake8` with an additional dependency `flake8-no-print`. The configuration also excludes files matching the pattern `prompts/.*.txt` from being processed by these hooks.
