# Purpose
The provided file is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration file, written in YAML, which automates the build and release process for a software project across multiple platforms. This file provides broad functionality by defining a series of jobs that are triggered on specific events, such as a push to the master branch or a manual dispatch. The workflow includes multiple jobs for different operating systems and architectures, such as macOS, Ubuntu, and Windows, each with specific build steps, dependencies, and configurations tailored to the target environment. The common theme of the file is to ensure that the software is built, packaged, and artifacts are uploaded for each platform, facilitating continuous integration and delivery. This file is crucial to the codebase as it automates the release process, ensuring consistency and efficiency in deploying new versions of the software.
# Content Summary
The provided YAML configuration file is a GitHub Actions workflow designed to automate the build and release process for a software project across multiple platforms and architectures. The workflow is named "Release" and is triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch` or automatically on pushes to the `master` branch, specifically when changes are made to certain files like `CMakeLists.txt` or source files with extensions such as `.cpp`, `.h`, and others.

Key components of the workflow include:

1. **Concurrency Management**: The workflow uses a concurrency group to ensure that only one instance of the workflow runs at a time for a given branch or run ID, with the option to cancel in-progress runs if a new one is triggered.

2. **Environment Variables**: It sets environment variables like `BRANCH_NAME` and `CMAKE_ARGS` to configure the build process, disabling certain build options and enabling others, such as building tools and server components.

3. **Jobs for Different Platforms**: The workflow defines multiple jobs to handle builds on various operating systems and architectures:
   - **macOS**: Separate jobs for `arm64` and `x64` architectures, using `brew` for dependencies and `cmake` for building.
   - **Ubuntu**: Jobs for CPU and Vulkan builds, with specific dependencies installed via `apt-get`.
   - **Windows**: Multiple jobs for different backends (CPU, CUDA, SYCL, HIP) and architectures, using `choco` for package management and `cmake` for building.
   - **iOS**: A job to build using Xcode for iOS targets.

4. **Artifact Management**: Each job includes steps to package build artifacts into zip files and upload them as GitHub Actions artifacts. The artifacts are named according to the platform and architecture.

5. **Release Creation**: A final job, `release`, is conditioned to run only if triggered by a push to the master branch or a manual input. It aggregates artifacts from all jobs, modifies them as needed, and creates a GitHub release. The release includes uploading all the packaged artifacts.

6. **Custom Actions**: The workflow uses custom actions, such as `get-tag-name` to determine the release tag and `windows-setup-curl` for setting up dependencies on Windows.

This workflow is comprehensive, covering a wide range of build environments and ensuring that the software is built, packaged, and released consistently across different platforms. It leverages GitHub Actions' capabilities to automate complex CI/CD processes, making it easier for developers to manage releases.
