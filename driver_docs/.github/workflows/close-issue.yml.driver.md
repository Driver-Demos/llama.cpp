# Purpose
The provided configuration file is a GitHub Actions workflow designed to automatically close inactive issues in a repository. It is scheduled to run daily at 00:42 UTC, as specified by the cron expression. The workflow grants write permissions to issues and pull requests, allowing it to modify and close them. The job, named "close-issues," utilizes the `actions/stale` action to identify and label issues as "stale" if they have been inactive for 30 days, and subsequently close them after an additional 14 days of inactivity. Certain issues with specific labels such as "refactor," "help wanted," and "bug" are exempt from being marked as stale, ensuring that important or ongoing discussions are not prematurely closed.
