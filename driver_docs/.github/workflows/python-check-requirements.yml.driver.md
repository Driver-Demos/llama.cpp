# Purpose
The provided content is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration file written in YAML format. This file defines an automated workflow named "Python check requirements.txt" that is triggered by push and pull request events affecting specific files, such as Python scripts and requirements files. The workflow ensures concurrency by grouping jobs and canceling any in-progress jobs if a new one is triggered. It specifies a job called "python-check-requirements" that runs on the latest Ubuntu environment, and includes steps to check out the source repository, set up a Python environment with version 3.11, and execute a shell script named `check-requirements.sh`. This setup is typically used to verify that the Python dependencies listed in the requirements files are correctly specified and up-to-date.
