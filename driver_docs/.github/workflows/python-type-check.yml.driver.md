# Purpose
The provided file is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration file written in YAML format. Its purpose is to automate the process of type-checking Python code using Pyright whenever there is a push or pull request affecting specific files in the repository, such as Python scripts, requirements files, or the workflow configuration itself. The workflow is set to run on the latest Ubuntu environment and includes steps to check out the source code, set up a Python environment with version 3.11, install necessary dependencies, and execute the Pyright type-checking tool. The concurrency settings ensure that only one instance of the workflow runs per branch or pull request, canceling any in-progress runs if a new one is triggered. This setup helps maintain code quality by ensuring type correctness in the codebase.
