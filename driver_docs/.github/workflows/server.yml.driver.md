# Purpose
The provided content is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration file, written in YAML, which automates the build and testing processes for a server application. This file is integral to the continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, enabling automated tasks to be triggered on specific events such as code pushes, pull requests, or manual dispatches. It defines two main jobs, one for a Linux environment and another for a Windows environment, each specifying a series of steps to set up dependencies, clone the repository, configure the build environment, and execute tests. The workflow includes a matrix strategy to test different build configurations and sanitizers, ensuring comprehensive coverage and robustness of the server application. This file is crucial for maintaining code quality and streamlining the development process by automating repetitive tasks and providing immediate feedback on code changes.
# Content Summary
The provided file is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration file named `server.yml`, which is designed to automate the build and testing processes for a server application. This workflow is triggered by specific events such as manual dispatch, pushes to the `master` branch, and pull request activities like opening, synchronizing, or reopening. The configuration specifies paths that, when modified, will trigger the workflow, including files like `CMakeLists.txt`, `Makefile`, and various source code files.

The workflow defines two main jobs: `server` and `server-windows`, which run on `ubuntu-latest` and `windows-2022` environments, respectively. The `server` job utilizes a matrix strategy to test different build configurations, specifically focusing on sanitizers like `ADDRESS` and `UNDEFINED`, while excluding `THREAD` due to known issues. The job includes steps for setting up dependencies, cloning the repository, setting up Python and Node.js environments, and verifying code format and build integrity. It also includes conditional steps for building the server with or without sanitizers and running integration tests, including optional slow tests.

The `server-windows` job is tailored for a Windows environment and includes steps for cloning the repository, setting up libCURL, building the server, and running tests. It ensures the necessary dependencies are installed and configured, and it handles the copying of required DLLs for the build process. Both jobs are designed to ensure that the server application is built correctly and passes all necessary tests before changes are integrated into the main codebase.

The workflow also includes environment variables for logging configurations and uses concurrency controls to manage workflow execution, ensuring that only one instance of a workflow group runs at a time, with the ability to cancel in-progress runs if a new one is triggered. This setup is crucial for maintaining code quality and reliability in a continuous integration and deployment pipeline.
