# Purpose
The provided content is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration file written in YAML format. This file defines a continuous integration workflow named "EditorConfig Checker" that is triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch`, on pushes to the `master` branch, and on pull requests targeting the `master` branch. The workflow ensures that only one instance runs at a time by using a concurrency group based on the workflow and reference identifiers. It specifies a job named `editorconfig` that runs on the latest Ubuntu environment, which includes steps to check out the repository code and execute the EditorConfig Checker action to validate the project's adherence to EditorConfig rules, using version 3.0.3 of the checker. This setup helps maintain consistent coding styles across the codebase by automatically checking for compliance with the defined EditorConfig settings.
