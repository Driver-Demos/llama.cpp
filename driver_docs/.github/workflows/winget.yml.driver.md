# Purpose
The provided file is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration written in YAML, designed to automate the process of updating a Winget package. The workflow is triggered manually or scheduled to run daily at 5:28 UTC. It defines a job named "Update Winget Package" that executes on the latest Ubuntu environment. The job consists of several steps: installing the `cargo-binstall` tool, installing a specific version of `komac`, finding the latest release of a repository using a GitHub script, and updating the Winget package manifest with the new version information. The manifest update includes setting the download URL for the new release and submitting the update using a GitHub token stored in secrets, ensuring the package is kept current with the latest software release.
