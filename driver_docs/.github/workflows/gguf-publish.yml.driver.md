# Purpose
The provided content is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration file designed to automate the process of uploading a Python package to a package registry using Twine. This workflow is triggered either manually via `workflow_dispatch` or automatically when a new tag matching the pattern `gguf-v*` is pushed, indicating a new release version. The workflow runs on the latest Ubuntu environment and includes several steps: checking out the repository code, setting up Python 3.9.x, installing dependencies using Poetry, building the package, and finally publishing it to PyPI using a secure API token stored in GitHub secrets. This setup ensures that the package deployment process is consistent and secure, leveraging third-party actions to facilitate the build and publish tasks.
