# Purpose
The provided content is a configuration file for GitHub Actions, specifically for the "labeler" action, which is used to automatically apply labels to pull requests based on the files that have been changed. Each section in the file corresponds to a specific label, such as "Kompute," "Apple Metal," "SYCL," and others, and lists file paths or patterns that, when modified, will trigger the application of the respective label to a pull request. This setup helps in categorizing and managing pull requests by automatically tagging them with relevant labels, which can streamline the review process and improve project organization. The use of glob patterns allows for flexible matching of file paths, ensuring that changes across various directories and file types are accurately captured and labeled.
