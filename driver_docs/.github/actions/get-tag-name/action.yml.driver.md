# Purpose
The provided content is a YAML configuration file for a GitHub Action, which is a workflow automation tool used in software development. This file defines a composite action named "Determine tag name," which is designed to generate a tag name for a software release. The action outputs a tag name based on the current branch and commit information. If the branch is "master," the tag is formatted as "b" followed by the build number. For other branches, the tag includes a sanitized branch name, the build number, and a short commit hash. This ensures that each release can be uniquely identified and associated with its source branch and commit.
