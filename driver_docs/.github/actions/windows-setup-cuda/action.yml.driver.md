# Purpose
This file is a YAML configuration file used in a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the setup of the CUDA Toolkit on Windows systems. It provides a narrow functionality focused on installing specific versions of the CUDA Toolkit, which is essential for running applications that leverage NVIDIA's GPU computing capabilities. The file contains two main components: the `inputs` section, which specifies the required CUDA version, and the `runs` section, which defines the steps to download, extract, and configure the CUDA Toolkit for the specified version. This configuration is crucial for ensuring that the correct CUDA environment is set up in continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, allowing developers to build and test GPU-accelerated applications consistently.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a configuration file for setting up the CUDA Toolkit on Windows systems. This file is structured to be used in a CI/CD pipeline, likely within a GitHub Actions workflow, as indicated by the use of environment variables like `$env:GITHUB_PATH` and `$env:GITHUB_ENV`. The file is designed to automate the installation of specific versions of the CUDA Toolkit, namely versions 11.7 and 12.4.

Key technical details include:

1. **Inputs Section**: The configuration requires an input parameter `cuda_version`, which is mandatory. This parameter determines which version of the CUDA Toolkit will be installed.

2. **Runs Section**: The file uses a composite run step, which allows for multiple steps to be executed in sequence. Each step is conditional based on the `cuda_version` input.

3. **Installation Steps**:
   - For CUDA version 11.7, the script creates a directory for the installation, installs the `unzip` utility using Chocolatey, and downloads several CUDA components using `curl`. These components include `cuda_cudart`, `cuda_nvcc`, `cuda_nvrtc`, `libcublas`, `cuda_nvtx`, `visual_studio_integration`, `cuda_nvprof`, and `cuda_cccl`. The downloaded archives are unzipped, and their contents are copied to the installation directory. Environment variables are then set to update the system path and define CUDA-related paths.
   - For CUDA version 12.4, a similar process is followed, with the script downloading the corresponding version-specific components. Additional components like `cuda_profiler_api` are included in this version. The installation directory is updated, and environment variables are set accordingly.

4. **Environment Configuration**: After installation, the script appends the CUDA binary and library paths to the system's PATH environment variable and sets CUDA-specific environment variables to ensure the system recognizes the installed toolkit.

This configuration file is crucial for developers who need to automate the setup of the CUDA Toolkit in a Windows environment, ensuring that the correct version is installed and configured for use in subsequent build or deployment steps.
