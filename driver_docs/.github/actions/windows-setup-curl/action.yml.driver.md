# Purpose
The provided content is a YAML configuration file for a GitHub Actions composite action named "Windows - Setup CURL." This action is designed to be reused in other workflows to automate the setup of the CURL tool on Windows environments. It accepts two optional inputs: `curl_version`, which specifies the version of CURL to download, and `architecture`, which determines the architecture of the libcurl to be downloaded, with default values set to '8.6.0_6' and 'win64', respectively. The action outputs the path to the downloaded libcurl, which is stored in the `curl_path` output variable. The action runs a series of steps using PowerShell to download the specified version of CURL, extract it, and set the output path for use in subsequent workflow steps.
