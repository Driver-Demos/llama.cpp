# Purpose
The provided content is a configuration file for a GitHub issue template, specifically designed to facilitate the tracking and documentation of new technical research areas within a project. The template is structured to guide users through the research process by providing sections for background research, hypothesis formation, implementation strategy, analysis of results, and documentation. It includes a markdown section with a reminder to check for duplicate research issues, a set of checkboxes to track the research stage, and multiple text areas for detailed input on various aspects of the research. This structured approach ensures that all necessary information is captured systematically, promoting thoroughness and consistency in documenting research efforts.
