# Purpose
The provided content is a configuration file for a GitHub issue template, specifically designed to track refactoring opportunities within a software project. The template is intended for maintainers and contributors to document and discuss potential refactoring tasks. It includes metadata such as the name, description, and labels to categorize the issue as a "refactor." The body of the template is structured to guide users in providing detailed information, including a markdown section with links to existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplication, and text areas for contributors to describe the background and possible approaches for the refactoring. The template ensures that essential information is captured by requiring a background description, while allowing flexibility in suggesting refactoring approaches.
