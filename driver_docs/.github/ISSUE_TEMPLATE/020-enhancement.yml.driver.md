# Purpose
The provided content is a GitHub issue template designed for submitting enhancement requests for the `llama.cpp` project. This template guides users through the process of proposing new features by ensuring they first discuss their ideas in the project's discussion forum to gain community consensus. It includes a series of structured fields such as checkboxes for prerequisites, and text areas for detailed descriptions of the feature, its motivation, and possible implementation strategies. The template enforces certain requirements, such as confirming the user is running the latest code and has reviewed existing discussions, to maintain the quality and relevance of enhancement requests. This structured approach helps streamline the submission process, ensuring that only well-considered and community-backed enhancements are proposed.
