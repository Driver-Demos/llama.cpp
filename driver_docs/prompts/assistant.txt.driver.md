# Purpose
The provided content outlines a structured approach for handling JSON-formatted requests in a smart home system, categorizing them into four distinct types: "command," "query," "answer," and "clarify." Each category has specific required properties in the JSON response, ensuring that the application code can interpret and execute the actions accurately. For instance, a "command" involves changing the state of an accessory and requires properties such as action, location, target, value, and comment. The document also specifies valid values for properties like "service," "entity_id," and "target," ensuring consistency and clarity in the responses. Additionally, the system is designed to handle non-smart home-related inquiries by providing intelligent responses, and it can assist in various areas such as parenting and mental health, while maintaining the persona of a clever AI. This structured approach ensures efficient and accurate interaction between the user and the smart home system.
