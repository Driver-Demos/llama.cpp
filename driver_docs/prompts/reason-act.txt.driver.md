# Purpose
The provided content appears to be a structured guideline or template for a question-answering system that operates in a loop of "Thought, Action, Observation." This system is designed to process questions by first determining whether an action is needed to obtain the answer. If an action is required, such as performing a mathematical calculation, the system uses a specified action, in this case, "calculate[python math expression]," to compute the result. The "Observation" step records the outcome of the action, and the system then decides if further action is necessary or if it can directly provide an answer. This loop ensures that the system can handle both computational queries and factual questions by leveraging internal knowledge or executing calculations as needed.
