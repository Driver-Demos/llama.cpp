# Purpose
The provided content is a Dockerfile used to build and configure multiple Docker images for a software application that utilizes Intel's oneAPI Base Toolkit. The file defines several stages, starting with a build stage that compiles the application using CMake with specific configurations, such as enabling SYCL support and setting various compiler options. It then creates three distinct images: "full," "light," and "server." The "full" image includes all application components and dependencies, along with Python scripts and tools, and sets up the environment for running the application with a script entry point. The "light" image is a minimal version intended for command-line interface (CLI) usage, while the "server" image is configured to run a server instance, complete with a health check endpoint. Each image is based on a common "base" image that ensures necessary system libraries and tools are installed and cleans up unnecessary files to optimize the image size.
