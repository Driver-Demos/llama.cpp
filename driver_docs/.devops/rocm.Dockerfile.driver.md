# Purpose
This file is a Dockerfile, which is used to automate the creation of Docker images for software deployment. It configures a multi-stage build process for a software application that relies on AMD's ROCm platform, targeting specific GPU architectures. The file defines several build stages, including `build`, `base`, `full`, `light`, and `server`, each tailored for different deployment scenarios. The `build` stage compiles the application with specific ROCm and AMDGPU versions, while the `base` stage sets up a minimal environment. The `full`, `light`, and `server` stages create images for different use cases: a complete environment, a command-line interface, and a server setup, respectively. This Dockerfile is crucial for ensuring consistent and efficient deployment of the application across various environments, leveraging containerization to encapsulate dependencies and configurations.
# Content Summary
This Dockerfile is designed to build and configure a containerized environment for a software project that utilizes AMD's ROCm platform. The file is structured to create multiple Docker images, each tailored for different use cases: a full development environment, a lightweight command-line interface (CLI), and a server setup.

Key technical details include:

1. **Base Image Configuration**: The Dockerfile begins by setting up a base image using the ROCm development container, specifically targeting Ubuntu 24.04 with ROCm version 6.3. This base image is essential for ensuring compatibility with the ROCm platform and its associated libraries.

2. **Architecture Support**: The file specifies a range of AMD GPU architectures (e.g., gfx803, gfx900, gfx906) that the build should support. This is crucial for developers to ensure that the software can run on various hardware configurations supported by ROCm.

3. **Build Process**: The build stage installs necessary development tools and libraries such as `build-essential`, `cmake`, and `git`. It then compiles the project using CMake with specific flags to enable HIP (Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability) and other backend options. The compiled shared libraries are then organized into specific directories for later use.

4. **Image Variants**:
   - **Full Image**: This variant includes all components necessary for a complete development environment. It installs Python and its dependencies, ensuring that the full suite of tools and scripts is available.
   - **Light Image**: This is a minimal setup that only includes the CLI tool, `llama-cli`, for users who need command-line access without the overhead of a full development environment.
   - **Server Image**: Configured to run a server application, `llama-server`, with a health check endpoint to ensure the server's availability. This setup is optimized for deployment scenarios where the application needs to be accessible over a network.

5. **Environment and Cleanup**: The Dockerfile sets environment variables and performs cleanup operations to reduce the image size by removing unnecessary files and caches. This is important for optimizing the performance and storage requirements of the Docker images.

Overall, this Dockerfile provides a comprehensive setup for building and deploying applications on the ROCm platform, catering to different user needs through its modular image configurations.
