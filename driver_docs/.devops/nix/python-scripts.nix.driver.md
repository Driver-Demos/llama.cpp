# Purpose
The provided content is a Nix expression file used for building a Python package within the Nix package manager ecosystem. It defines a build environment for a package named "llama-scripts" with version "0.0.0", utilizing the `buildPythonPackage` function. The file specifies two sets of dependencies: `llama-python-deps` for the main package dependencies, including libraries like `numpy`, `transformers`, and `torchWithoutCuda`, and `llama-python-test-deps` for testing dependencies, such as `pytest` and `matplotlib`. The `src` attribute uses `lib.cleanSourceWith` to filter and include only specific files, such as Python scripts and essential project files like `README.md` and `pyproject.toml`, ensuring that unnecessary files do not affect the build output. Additionally, `poetry-core` is included as a native build input to facilitate the package's build process.
