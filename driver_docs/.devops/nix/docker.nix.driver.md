# Purpose
The provided file is a Nix expression used to configure the building of a Docker image using Nix's `dockerTools.buildLayeredImage` function. This configuration specifies the creation of a Docker image for the `llama-cpp` package, tagging it as "latest". The image includes the `llama-cpp` package itself and conditionally includes additional utilities such as `coreutils`, `dockerTools.binSh`, and `dockerTools.caCertificates` if the `interactive` flag is set to true. The comments provide instructions on how to build and load the Docker image using Nix commands, as well as links to further documentation and discussions on optimizing Docker image builds with Nix. Additionally, it provides approximate sizes for different Docker image configurations, giving users an idea of the storage requirements.
