# Purpose
The provided content is a Nix expression used to configure the building of a Singularity container image for a software project involving the `llama-cpp` library. This configuration specifies dependencies such as `singularity-tools` and optionally includes `bashInteractive` if the `interactive` flag is set to true. The `optionalInt` function is defined to conditionally add a value to the disk size if the `useRocm` flag is enabled within `llama-cpp`, indicating additional resources are needed for ROCm support. The configuration also outlines expected image sizes for different build variants and notes that building Singularity images requires superuser privileges, thus necessitating the use of a virtual machine with a writable image of a predetermined size. This setup ensures that the container image is built with the necessary resources and dependencies, tailored to the specific requirements of the `llama-cpp` library.
