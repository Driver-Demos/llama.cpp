# Purpose
The provided content is a Nix expression used for configuring package builds in a Nix-based system, specifically targeting different NVIDIA Jetson platforms. It defines a `perSystem` function that takes several parameters, including `config`, `system`, `lib`, and `pkgsCuda`, to configure CUDA support for different Jetson models. The `legacyPackages` section specifies CUDA capability versions for various Jetson devices, such as Xavier, Orin, TX2, and Nano. The `pkgsFor` function imports a Nix package set with CUDA support enabled, tailored to the specified CUDA capabilities. Finally, the `packages` attribute conditionally includes specific packages for the `aarch64-linux` system, mapping them to the appropriate Jetson models based on their CUDA capabilities.
