# Purpose
The provided configuration file is written in a Nix expression language and is used to define module arguments for a Nix-based system, specifically focusing on package management with CUDA and ROCm support. The file outlines a `perSystem` function that takes a `system` argument and sets up module arguments, particularly `_module.args`, which are passed to other modules. It imports instances of `nixpkgs` with specific configurations to ensure that dependencies are consistently built with CUDA and ROCm support, as indicated by the `config.cudaSupport` and `config.rocmSupport` flags. The configuration also addresses licensing concerns by allowing certain non-free licenses, such as "CUDA EULA" and "cuDNN EULA," to be used. Additionally, the file comments on the performance implications of creating multiple `nixpkgs` instances, noting that this approach may be slow and could hinder dependency injection, suggesting potential future changes.
