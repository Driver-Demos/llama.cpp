# Purpose
The provided content is a Dockerfile, which is used to automate the creation of Docker images for software deployment. This file specifies a multi-stage build process for a software application that utilizes the MUSA (presumably a software or library) environment. It defines several build stages, including `build`, `base`, `full`, `light`, and `server`, each tailored for different deployment scenarios such as full application deployment, command-line interface (CLI) only, and server-only configurations. The Dockerfile sets up the necessary environment by installing dependencies, copying application files, and configuring the build process using CMake. The relevance of this file to a codebase is significant as it encapsulates the environment setup, dependency management, and application packaging, ensuring consistent and reproducible builds across different environments.
# Content Summary
This Dockerfile is designed to build and configure a multi-stage Docker image for a software project that utilizes the MUSA (Multi-Threaded Unified Software Architecture) framework. The file is structured to create different Docker images for development, full deployment, light CLI-only deployment, and server-only deployment.

1. **Base Image Configuration**: The file begins by defining several build arguments, such as `UBUNTU_VERSION` and `MUSA_VERSION`, which specify the Ubuntu version and MUSA version to be used. These arguments are used to construct the base development and runtime container images (`BASE_MUSA_DEV_CONTAINER` and `BASE_MUSA_RUN_CONTAINER`) from the `mthreads/musa` repository.

2. **Build Stage**: The `build` stage uses the development container as its base. It installs essential build tools and libraries, such as `build-essential`, `cmake`, `python3`, and `git`. The working directory is set to `/app`, and the source code is copied into this directory. The build process is configured using CMake, with options to enable MUSA and other specific backend features. The compiled shared libraries (`*.so`) are copied to `/app/lib`.

3. **Base Runtime Image**: The `base` stage is derived from the runtime container. It installs necessary runtime libraries like `libgomp1` and `curl`, and performs cleanup to reduce image size.

4. **Full Deployment Image**: The `full` stage extends the `base` image, copying the complete application, including Python scripts and dependencies, into the container. It installs Python and pip, upgrades them, and installs the required Python packages from `requirements.txt`. The entry point is set to a script located at `/app/tools.sh`.

5. **Light CLI-Only Image**: The `light` stage is a minimal image that only includes the CLI tool `llama-cli`. It sets the entry point to this CLI tool, making it suitable for command-line interactions.

6. **Server-Only Image**: The `server` stage is tailored for server deployment. It sets an environment variable `LLAMA_ARG_HOST` to `0.0.0.0`, allowing the server to listen on all network interfaces. The `llama-server` executable is copied into the image, and a health check is configured to ensure the server is running correctly. The entry point is set to the server executable.

Overall, this Dockerfile provides a flexible and efficient way to build and deploy different configurations of the MUSA-based application, catering to development, full deployment, CLI-only, and server-only use cases.
