# Purpose
This file is a Dockerfile used to automate the creation of Docker images for a software application. It defines multiple stages to build and package the application, starting with a build stage that uses an Ubuntu base image to install necessary build tools and dependencies, such as Vulkan SDK and cURL, and compiles the application using CMake. The build artifacts are then organized into specific directories for different deployment configurations. The Dockerfile specifies three distinct final images: "full," which includes the complete application with Python dependencies; "light," which is a command-line interface (CLI) only version; and "server," which is configured to run as a server with a health check endpoint. Each image is based on a common "base" image that includes essential runtime libraries, ensuring a consistent environment across different deployment scenarios.
