# Purpose
The provided code is a Jenkins pipeline script designed to automate the process of building and running a software project called "llama.cpp" on an x86 architecture runner. The script is structured into several stages: it begins with a cleanup stage to remove any previous build artifacts from the workspace, ensuring a fresh environment for the current build. It then proceeds to check out the source code from a version control system, with a retry mechanism in place to handle potential cloning failures. The next stage involves compiling the "llama.cpp" project specifically for the RISC-V architecture using a Makefile with specific flags for RISC-V cross-compilation. Finally, the script runs the compiled project using QEMU, a processor emulator, configured for RISC-V, and logs the output to a file, which is subsequently displayed. This pipeline facilitates continuous integration by automating the build and test process for the "llama.cpp" project.
