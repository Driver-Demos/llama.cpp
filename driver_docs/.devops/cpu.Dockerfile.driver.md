# Purpose
The provided content is a Dockerfile used to automate the building and deployment of a software application across different environments. It begins by defining a base image using a specified version of Ubuntu, and sets up a multi-stage build process to optimize the final image size. The build stage compiles the application using CMake, tailored for different CPU architectures, and organizes the compiled binaries and necessary scripts into specific directories. Subsequent stages create different Docker images for various deployment scenarios: a full image with all dependencies and scripts, a light image for command-line interface usage, and a server image configured to run a server application with a health check endpoint. This structured approach allows for efficient and flexible deployment of the application in diverse environments.
