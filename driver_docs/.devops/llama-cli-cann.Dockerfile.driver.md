# Purpose
The provided content is a Dockerfile, which is used to automate the creation of Docker images for software deployment. This Dockerfile is designed to build and run an application using the Ascend AI software stack, specifically targeting a version of the CANN (Compute Architecture for Neural Networks) toolkit. It begins by setting up a build environment with necessary dependencies and environment variables, compiling the application using CMake, and then transitions to a runtime environment where the compiled application, `llama-cli`, is executed. The file ensures that the necessary libraries and paths are correctly configured for both the build and runtime stages, facilitating the deployment of the application in a consistent and isolated environment.
