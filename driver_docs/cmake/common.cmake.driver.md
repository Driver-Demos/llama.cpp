# Purpose
The provided content is a CMake script that defines a function named `llama_add_compile_flags`, which is used to configure compiler flags for a project. This function checks for specific conditions, such as whether `LLAMA_FATAL_WARNINGS` or `LLAMA_ALL_WARNINGS` are enabled, and adjusts the compilation flags accordingly. If `LLAMA_FATAL_WARNINGS` is set, it ensures that all warnings are treated as errors by appending the `-Werror` flag for GNU and Clang compilers, or `/WX` for MSVC. When `LLAMA_ALL_WARNINGS` is enabled, it adds a comprehensive set of warning flags to promote strict code quality, except for MSVC, where a placeholder comment indicates future work. The script also includes a call to `ggml_get_flags` to retrieve additional flags based on the compiler's ID and version, ensuring that the project adheres to rigorous coding standards across different compilers.
