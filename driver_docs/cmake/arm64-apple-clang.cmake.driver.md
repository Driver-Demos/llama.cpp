# Purpose
The provided content is a CMake configuration file that specifies the build settings for a software project targeting the Darwin operating system on an ARM64 architecture. It sets the system name and processor type, indicating that the build is intended for macOS on Apple Silicon hardware. The file designates `clang` and `clang++` as the C and C++ compilers, respectively, and configures them to target the specified architecture and platform using the `arm64-apple-darwin-macho` target triple. Additionally, it defines specific compiler flags for architecture optimizations and warning suppressions, which are initialized for both C and C++ compilation processes. This setup ensures that the software is compiled with the appropriate optimizations and compatibility for the target environment.
