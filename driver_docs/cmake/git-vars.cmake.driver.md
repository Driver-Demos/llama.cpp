# Purpose
The provided code is a CMake script that integrates Git version control information into the build process. It uses the `find_package(Git)` command to ensure that Git is available for use. The script then executes a series of Git commands to retrieve specific details about the current commit in the repository. It captures the commit's SHA1 hash, the date of the commit, and the commit's subject line, storing each in separate variables: `GIT_SHA1`, `GIT_DATE`, and `GIT_COMMIT_SUBJECT`, respectively. These variables can be used within the CMake build process to embed versioning information into the software, aiding in traceability and documentation of the build.
