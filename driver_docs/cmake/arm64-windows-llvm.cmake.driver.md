# Purpose
The provided content is a CMake configuration file that specifies the build environment and compiler settings for a software project targeting the ARM64 architecture on a Windows platform. It sets the system name and processor type to Windows and ARM64, respectively, and defines the target triple as "arm64-pc-windows-msvc," which is a convention used to specify the architecture, vendor, operating system, and compiler. The file configures the C and C++ compilers to use Clang and sets the compiler target to the specified architecture. Additionally, it initializes compiler flags for architecture-specific optimizations and warnings, such as enabling ARMv8.7-A architecture features and suppressing certain warnings, to ensure efficient and error-free compilation.
