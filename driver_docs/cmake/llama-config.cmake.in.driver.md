# Purpose
The provided file is a CMake configuration script used to set up and manage the build environment for a software project named "Llama." It defines several variables related to the version, build commit, and build number of the Llama project, as well as whether shared libraries should be built. The script sets and checks the installation directories for include files, libraries, and binaries, ensuring they are correctly configured. It also locates the required "ggml" package and the "llama" library, specifying their paths and linking requirements. The script configures the "llama" library as an imported target, setting its properties such as include directories, link libraries, and compile features, ensuring that the build process adheres to the specified standards and dependencies. Finally, it verifies that all necessary components for the Llama project are present, ensuring a successful build configuration.
