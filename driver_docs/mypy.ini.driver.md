# Purpose
This configuration file is for MyPy, a static type checker for Python. It sets the type-checking mode to strict while allowing untyped function calls, definitions, and incomplete definitions. It disables error reporting for untyped imports and suppresses warnings for functions that may return 'Any' type.
