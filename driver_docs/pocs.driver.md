## Folders
- **[vdot](pocs/vdot.driver.md)**: The `vdot` folder in the `llama.cpp` codebase contains files for configuring and implementing performance comparisons and benchmarks of dot product calculations using both quantized and floating-point data.

## Files
- **[CMakeLists.txt](pocs/CMakeLists.txt.driver.md)**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase specifies dependencies and includes directories, with conditional logic for adding a subdirectory based on the `GGML_BACKEND_DL` setting.
