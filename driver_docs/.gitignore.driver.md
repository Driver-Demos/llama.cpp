# Purpose
The provided file content is a `.gitignore` file, which is used in Git repositories to specify intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. This file lists various file extensions, directories, and specific files that are typically generated during the development process but should not be included in version control. These include compiled binaries, temporary files, build artifacts, IDE-specific files, and logs. Additionally, it includes specific exceptions using the `!` prefix, indicating files or directories that should be tracked despite matching an ignore pattern. The purpose of this file is to maintain a clean repository by excluding files that are not necessary for the source code management, thus preventing unnecessary clutter and potential conflicts in the version control system.
