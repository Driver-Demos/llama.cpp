# Purpose
The provided content is a documentation excerpt for a tool named `llama-imatrix`, which is part of the `llama.cpp` project. This tool is designed to compute an importance matrix for a given model and text dataset, which can be utilized to improve the quality of quantized models. The documentation outlines the usage of the tool, specifying mandatory parameters such as the model file (`-m`) and the text dataset file (`-f`), along with optional parameters that control output file naming, verbosity, and frequency of data saving. The importance matrix is particularly useful during the quantization process, as demonstrated in the example where it is used to perform a Q4_K_M quantization. The document also suggests using GPU offloading for faster computation, highlighting the tool's capability to enhance performance through hardware acceleration.
