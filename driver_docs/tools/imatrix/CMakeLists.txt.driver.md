# Purpose
This CMake configuration file defines the build instructions for an executable named "llama-imatrix" from the source file "imatrix.cpp". It specifies that the executable should be installed as a runtime target, links it with the "common" and "llama" libraries, as well as the CMake thread libraries, and enforces the use of C++17 standard features during compilation.
