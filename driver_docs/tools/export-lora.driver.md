## Files
- **[CMakeLists.txt](export-lora/CMakeLists.txt.driver.md)**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file in `llama.cpp/tools/export-lora` configures the build system to compile and install the `llama-export-lora` executable with C++17 standard and links it with the `common`, `llama`, and thread libraries.
- **[export-lora.cpp](export-lora/export-lora.cpp.driver.md)**: The `export-lora.cpp` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase provides functionality for merging a base model with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters and exporting the result as a GGUF file, with the output model being in F16 format.
- **[README.md](export-lora/README.md.driver.md)**: The `README.md` file in the `llama.cpp/tools/export-lora` directory provides instructions for using the `llama-export-lora` tool to apply LORA adapters to a base model and export the resulting model.
