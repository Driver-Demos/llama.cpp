# Purpose
The provided content is a CMake configuration file used to define the build process for a software library named "mtmd" and several related executables. This file specifies the source files and headers that make up the "mtmd" library, and it configures the necessary dependencies, such as linking with the "ggml" and "llama" libraries, as well as the "Threads" library. It sets up include directories and enforces the use of C++17 standards for compilation. The file also includes conditional settings for building shared libraries, such as enabling position-independent code and defining specific compile-time definitions. Additionally, it configures the installation of the library and its public headers, and it sets up the build process for several command-line interface executables, each linked with the "mtmd" library and other dependencies.
