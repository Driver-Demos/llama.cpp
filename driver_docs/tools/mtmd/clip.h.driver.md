# Purpose
This C++ header file is an internal component designed for use by the `mtmd` module, providing a specialized interface for handling image and audio data within a CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining) context. The file defines several structures and functions that facilitate the initialization, management, and processing of image and audio data, specifically tailored for machine learning models that utilize CLIP. Key structures include `clip_ctx`, which represents the context for processing, and `clip_image_size`, which holds dimensions for images. The file also defines various functions for initializing and freeing resources, encoding images, and managing image batches, indicating its role in efficiently handling image data for machine learning tasks.

The header file includes functions for loading images from files or byte arrays, preprocessing images, and encoding them into feature vectors, which are essential operations in the context of CLIP models. It also provides functionality to determine the presence of different types of encoders (vision, audio, whisper) and to handle specific model configurations. The file is not intended for broad use but rather serves as a focused utility within a specific module, emphasizing its role in managing image and audio data for machine learning applications. The presence of functions like `clip_image_preprocess` and `clip_image_encode` highlights its importance in preparing and transforming data for model consumption, while the use of `#pragma once` ensures that the header is included only once in a compilation, preventing duplicate definitions.
