# Purpose
This C++ source code file serves as an internal header for the `clip.cpp` implementation, providing a comprehensive set of definitions, utilities, and structures related to the CLIP (Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pretraining) model. The file includes a variety of constants, enumerations, and utility functions that facilitate the handling of different projector types, image and audio data structures, and logging mechanisms. It defines numerous string constants for configuration keys and tensor names, which are used to manage and access various parameters and components of the CLIP model, such as embedding lengths, attention head counts, and image-specific attributes like size and mean.

The file also includes structures for handling image data in both uint8 and float32 formats, supporting both RGB images and audio data. It provides logging utilities with different verbosity levels, allowing for detailed logging of operations and errors. Additionally, the file contains C++ wrapper structures for managing image data with automatic memory management using smart pointers. Utility functions for string manipulation and data conversion are also present, aiding in the processing and formatting of data within the CLIP model's context. Overall, this file is a crucial component of the CLIP implementation, providing essential infrastructure for managing model parameters, data handling, and logging.

    - Iterate over the fourth dimension of the tensor, printing the tensor's name and opening a bracket for the data.
    - For each slice in the third dimension, check if the current index equals `n` and if the dimension size is greater than `2*n`; if so, print ellipses and skip to the end of the dimension.
    - Open a bracket for the second dimension and iterate over it, applying the same ellipsis logic as the third dimension.
    - Open a bracket for the first dimension and iterate over it, applying the same ellipsis logic as the second dimension.
    - Calculate the index in the data array based on the current indices and the tensor's byte strides.
    - Convert the data at the calculated index to a float based on the tensor's type, using appropriate conversion functions for each type.
    - Print the converted float value, ensuring proper formatting and separation with commas.
    - Close the brackets for each dimension and print the closing bracket for the data array.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it outputs the formatted tensor data directly to the standard output.
