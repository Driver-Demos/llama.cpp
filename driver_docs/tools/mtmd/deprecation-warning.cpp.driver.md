# Purpose
This C++ code is an executable program, as indicated by the presence of the [`main`](#main) function, which serves as the entry point for execution. The program provides narrow functionality, primarily focused on issuing a deprecation warning for a binary file. It extracts the program's name from the command-line arguments, specifically from the full path of the executable, and then prints a warning message to the standard output, advising users to switch to a different binary named 'llama-mtmd-cli'. The program concludes by returning `EXIT_FAILURE`, signaling that the execution was unsuccessful, likely to emphasize the deprecated status of the binary.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function processes command-line arguments to extract the program name and prints a deprecation warning message before exiting with a failure status.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: An integer representing the number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of C-style strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a string `filename` with the default value 'main'.
    - Check if `argc` is greater than or equal to 1; if true, set `filename` to the first command-line argument `argv[0]`.
    - Find the last occurrence of a path separator ('/' or '\') in `filename` to isolate the program name.
    - If a path separator is found, update `filename` to only contain the program name after the last separator.
    - Print a deprecation warning message to the standard output, including the extracted program name.
    - Return `EXIT_FAILURE` to indicate the program terminated unsuccessfully.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value `EXIT_FAILURE`, indicating that the program has terminated with an error or failure status.
