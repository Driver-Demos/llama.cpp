# Purpose
This Python script is designed to process and extract specific components from a machine learning model, specifically a LLaVA v1.5 model, which is a variant of the LLaMA model. The script uses the `argparse` library to accept a command-line argument specifying the path to the model directory. It then utilizes the `glob` module to locate the latest model checkpoint file within the specified directory. The script loads this checkpoint using PyTorch's `torch.load` function and identifies tensors related to the multimodal projector and CLIP components within the model. These tensors are extracted and saved separately using `torch.save`, facilitating further processing or conversion of the model.

The script also includes functionality to handle specific model configurations, such as removing added tokens if they exist, which is necessary for converting Mistral models. The output of the script includes instructions for converting the processed model into a regular LLaMA GGUF file and preparing a llava-encoder GGUF file. This script is primarily a utility tool for model conversion and preparation, focusing on extracting and saving specific components of a machine learning model for further use or transformation. It does not define a public API or external interface but serves as a standalone script for model manipulation tasks.

- `torch`


# Global Variables

---
### ap
- **Type**: `argparse.ArgumentParser`
- **Description**: The variable `ap` is an instance of `argparse.ArgumentParser`, which is used to handle command-line arguments in Python scripts. It is configured to accept a single argument, `-m` or `--model`, which specifies the path to the LLaVA v1.5 model.
- **Use**: This variable is used to parse command-line arguments, specifically to obtain the path to the model directory needed for further processing in the script.


---
### args
- **Type**: `argparse.Namespace`
- **Description**: The `args` variable is an instance of `argparse.Namespace` that holds the parsed command-line arguments. It is created by calling `parse_args()` on an `ArgumentParser` object, which processes the command-line input according to the defined arguments. In this code, it specifically stores the path to the LLaVA v1.5 model provided by the user.
- **Use**: This variable is used to access the command-line argument for the model path, which is then utilized to locate and process model files.


---
### path
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `path` variable is a string that holds the file path to the latest PyTorch model binary file within a specified model directory. It is determined by searching for files matching the pattern 'pytorch_model*.bin' in the directory specified by the `args.model` argument, sorting them, and selecting the last one in the sorted list.
- **Use**: This variable is used to load the PyTorch model checkpoint from the specified file path.


---
### checkpoint
- **Type**: `torch.Tensor`
- **Description**: The `checkpoint` variable is a PyTorch tensor loaded from a file path that is dynamically determined based on the model path provided as an argument. It contains the weights and parameters of a model, specifically the multimodal projector weights and potentially CLIP tensors, which are used in further processing steps.
- **Use**: This variable is used to extract specific tensor names for further processing and saving, such as multimodal projector weights and CLIP tensors.


---
### mm\_tensors
- **Type**: `list`
- **Description**: The `mm_tensors` variable is a list that contains the names of tensors from a loaded checkpoint that are associated with the multimodal projector component of a model. It is constructed by iterating over the items in the checkpoint and selecting those whose keys start with 'model.mm_projector'. This indicates that the tensors are part of the model's multimodal projection layer.
- **Use**: This variable is used to identify and extract the specific tensors related to the multimodal projector from the model checkpoint for further processing or saving.


---
### projector
- **Type**: `dictionary`
- **Description**: The `projector` variable is a dictionary that stores specific tensors from a loaded model checkpoint. These tensors are identified by their names, which start with 'model.mm_projector', and are converted to float type before being stored in the dictionary.
- **Use**: This variable is used to save the multimodal projector weights from a model checkpoint into a separate file for further processing or use.


---
### clip\_tensors
- **Type**: `list`
- **Description**: The `clip_tensors` variable is a list that contains the names of tensors from a loaded model checkpoint, specifically those that start with the prefix 'model.vision_tower'. This indicates that these tensors are part of the vision tower component of the model, which is likely related to the CLIP (Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pretraining) architecture.
- **Use**: This variable is used to identify and extract CLIP-related tensors from the model checkpoint for further processing or saving.
