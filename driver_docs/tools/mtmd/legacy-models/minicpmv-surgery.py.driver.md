# Purpose
This Python script is designed to process and convert a pre-trained MiniCPM-V model, which is a type of transformer model, into a format that can be further utilized or converted into other model formats. The script uses the `argparse` library to handle command-line arguments, specifically to accept the path to the MiniCPM-V model. It leverages the `transformers` library to load the model and its tokenizer, and it processes the model's state dictionary to extract specific tensor weights related to multimodal projector components and potentially other components prefixed with "vpm". These extracted components are then saved separately using PyTorch's `torch.save` function.

The script also modifies the model's configuration to map it to specific MiniCPM configurations and model classes, which are presumably defined elsewhere in the user's environment. This suggests that the script is part of a larger workflow for model conversion or preparation, particularly for converting the model into a format compatible with LLaMA GGUF files. Additionally, the script ensures that any added tokens are removed from the model's directory, which is necessary for compatibility with Mistral models. The script concludes by saving the modified model and tokenizer to the specified directory, providing clear instructions for subsequent conversion steps. This indicates that the script is a utility tool intended for model preparation and conversion tasks within a machine learning pipeline.

# Global Variables

---
### ap
- **Type**: `argparse.ArgumentParser`
- **Description**: The variable `ap` is an instance of `argparse.ArgumentParser`, which is used to handle command-line arguments in Python scripts. It is configured to accept a single argument, `-m` or `--model`, which specifies the path to the MiniCPM-V model.
- **Use**: This variable is used to parse command-line arguments, specifically to obtain the path to the model that will be processed in the script.


---
### args
- **Type**: `argparse.Namespace`
- **Description**: The `args` variable is an instance of `argparse.Namespace` that holds the parsed command-line arguments. It is created by calling `parse_args()` on an `ArgumentParser` object, which processes the command-line input according to the arguments defined in the parser.
- **Use**: This variable is used to access the command-line argument values, specifically the model path, which is then used to load a pre-trained model and perform subsequent operations.


---
### model
- **Type**: `AutoModel`
- **Description**: The `model` variable is an instance of the `AutoModel` class, initialized using the `from_pretrained` method with the model path specified by the user through command-line arguments. It is configured to trust remote code, use only local files, and set the data type for PyTorch tensors to `bfloat16`. This setup is typically used for loading pre-trained models in a specific format for further processing or fine-tuning.
- **Use**: The `model` variable is used to load a pre-trained model, extract its state dictionary, and facilitate the processing and saving of specific tensor components for further use.


---
### checkpoint
- **Type**: `dictionary`
- **Description**: The `checkpoint` variable is a dictionary that holds the state dictionary of the model loaded from a pre-trained model using the `AutoModel.from_pretrained` method. This state dictionary contains all the parameters and buffers of the model, which are essential for saving and loading the model's state.
- **Use**: This variable is used to extract specific tensor names and their corresponding values for further processing and saving.


---
### mm\_tensors
- **Type**: `list`
- **Description**: The `mm_tensors` variable is a list that contains the names of tensors from the model's state dictionary that start with the prefix 'resampler'. This is used to identify and isolate specific parts of the model's weights related to the multimodal projector.
- **Use**: This variable is used to filter and collect the names of tensors that are part of the multimodal projector weights from the model's state dictionary.


---
### projector
- **Type**: `dictionary`
- **Description**: The `projector` variable is a dictionary that stores specific tensors from a model's state dictionary. These tensors are identified by their names, which start with 'resampler', and are converted to float type before being stored in the dictionary.
- **Use**: This variable is used to save the multimodal projector weights of a model to a file for later use.


---
### clip\_tensors
- **Type**: `list`
- **Description**: The `clip_tensors` variable is a list that contains the names of tensors from the model's state dictionary whose keys start with the prefix 'vpm'. This list is used to identify specific parts of the model's state that are related to a particular functionality or component, likely associated with a 'clip' operation or module.
- **Use**: This variable is used to filter and identify tensors from the model's state dictionary for further processing and saving.


---
### config
- **Type**: `object`
- **Description**: The `config` variable is an object that represents the configuration settings of a language model. It is derived from the `model.llm.config` attribute, which is part of the model loaded using the `AutoModel` class from the `transformers` library. The `config` object is then modified to include an `auto_map` dictionary that maps various model components to their corresponding classes in the `minicpm` module.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and modify the configuration settings of the language model, specifically to map model components to their respective classes for further processing or saving.


---
### tok
- **Type**: `AutoTokenizer`
- **Description**: The `tok` variable is an instance of the `AutoTokenizer` class, which is initialized using the `from_pretrained` method with the model path specified in `args.model`. This tokenizer is configured to trust remote code, allowing it to load tokenizer configurations from remote sources.
- **Use**: The `tok` variable is used to handle tokenization tasks for the specified model and is saved to the model directory for future use.
