# Purpose
This Python script is designed to process a GLM (General Language Model) model by extracting specific components related to multimodal projector weights and vision model tensors. It utilizes the `argparse` library to handle command-line arguments, specifically to receive the path to the GLM model. The script leverages the `transformers` library to load the model using `AutoModel.from_pretrained`, ensuring that only local files are used and remote code is trusted. The primary functionality of the script is to identify and extract tensors associated with the vision adapter and vision model components from the model's state dictionary. These tensors are then saved separately using `torch.save`, facilitating further processing or conversion tasks.

The script also includes a conditional operation to handle additional tokens, which are removed if they exist, to enable the conversion of Mistral models. The output files, `glm.projector` and `glm.clip`, are saved in the specified model directory, and the script concludes by printing instructions for converting the model to a regular LLaMA GGUF file and preparing a glm-encoder GGUF file. This script is a utility tool, likely intended for use in a larger workflow involving model conversion or preparation for specific machine learning tasks, particularly those involving vision and language models.

# Global Variables

---
### ap
- **Type**: `argparse.ArgumentParser`
- **Description**: The variable `ap` is an instance of `argparse.ArgumentParser`, which is used to handle command-line arguments in Python scripts. It is configured to accept a single argument, `-m` or `--model`, which specifies the path to a GLM model.
- **Use**: This variable is used to parse command-line arguments, specifically to obtain the path to a GLM model, which is then used to load the model and process its components.


---
### args
- **Type**: `argparse.Namespace`
- **Description**: The `args` variable is an instance of `argparse.Namespace` that holds the parsed command-line arguments. It is created by calling `parse_args()` on an `ArgumentParser` object, which processes the command-line input according to the defined arguments.
- **Use**: This variable is used to access the command-line argument values, specifically the path to the GLM model, which is then used to load the model and perform subsequent operations.


---
### model
- **Type**: `AutoModel`
- **Description**: The `model` variable is an instance of the `AutoModel` class, which is loaded using the `from_pretrained` method. This method initializes the model with pre-trained weights specified by the `args.model` path, allowing for remote code execution and ensuring that only local files are used.
- **Use**: The `model` variable is used to load a pre-trained model, which is then utilized to extract and manipulate specific tensor weights for further processing and saving.


---
### checkpoint
- **Type**: `dict`
- **Description**: The `checkpoint` variable is a dictionary that holds the state dictionary of the model loaded from a pre-trained model file. This state dictionary contains all the parameters and persistent buffers (e.g., running averages) of the model, indexed by their names.
- **Use**: This variable is used to extract specific tensor names related to the multimodal projector and vision model, which are then saved separately for further processing.


---
### mm\_tensors
- **Type**: `list`
- **Description**: The `mm_tensors` variable is a list that contains the names of tensors from the model's state dictionary that are associated with the vision adapter component. These tensor names are identified by checking if they start with the prefix 'vision.adapter.'. This list is used to filter out specific parts of the model's state dictionary that are relevant to the multimodal projector weights.
- **Use**: This variable is used to identify and extract the relevant tensor names for the vision adapter, which are then stored in a new dictionary and saved for further processing.


---
### projector
- **Type**: `dictionary`
- **Description**: The `projector` variable is a dictionary that stores specific tensors from a model's state dictionary. These tensors are identified by their names, which start with 'vision.adapter.', and are converted to float type before being stored in the dictionary.
- **Use**: This variable is used to save the multimodal projector weights of a model to a file for later use.


---
### clip\_tensors
- **Type**: `list`
- **Description**: The `clip_tensors` variable is a list that contains the names of tensors from the model's state dictionary that start with the prefix 'vision.vit.model.vision_model.'. It is used to identify specific parts of the model related to the vision transformer (ViT) component.
- **Use**: This variable is used to filter and store tensor names related to the vision model, which are then processed and saved separately.
