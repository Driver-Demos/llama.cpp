# Purpose
This Python script is designed to process and convert models, specifically CLIP models, into a format compatible with GGUF (a file format for storing machine learning models). The script provides functionality to handle different configurations of CLIP models, including text-only, vision-only, and multi-modal models, as well as specific configurations like LLaVA models. It uses the `argparse` library to parse command-line arguments, allowing users to specify various options such as the model directory, output directory, and model type (e.g., OpenCLIP, Siglip). The script also supports different data types (float32 and float16) and handles the conversion of model weights accordingly.

The script's core functionality involves reading model configurations and weights, processing them based on the specified options, and writing the processed data into a GGUF file. It utilizes libraries such as `torch` for handling model weights and `numpy` for numerical operations. The script includes functions to determine which tensors to skip, standardize tensor names, and convert byte data to Unicode. It also manages the configuration of text and vision encoders, ensuring that the output file contains the necessary metadata and tensor data for the specified model type. The script is structured to be executed as a standalone script, with no public APIs or external interfaces defined for import into other modules.
