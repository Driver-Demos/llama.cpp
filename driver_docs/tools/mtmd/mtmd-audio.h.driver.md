# Purpose
This C++ header file provides a narrow functionality focused on audio preprocessing, specifically for a system that likely involves audio analysis or transformation, such as a speech recognition or audio processing application. It defines constants related to audio processing parameters, such as sample rate and FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) settings, which are crucial for audio signal analysis. The code introduces two primary structures, `whisper_mel` and `whisper_filters`, which are used to store mel spectrogram data and filter parameters, respectively. The `preprocess_audio` function is declared to process audio samples using specified filters and output the results into a vector of `whisper_mel` structures. Additionally, the `whisper_precalc_filters` namespace provides a function to retrieve predefined filter settings, specifically for 128 frequency bins. This header is intended to be included in other C++ files where audio preprocessing is required, leveraging the `ggml` library for assertions and possibly other functionalities.

# Data Structures

---
### whisper\_mel<!-- {{#data_structure:whisper_preprocessor::whisper_mel}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `n_len`: Represents the length of the data in the mel spectrogram.
    - `n_len_org`: Stores the original length of the data before any processing.
    - `n_mel`: Indicates the number of mel frequency bins.
    - `data`: A vector of floats containing the mel spectrogram data.
- **Description**: The `whisper_mel` struct is designed to represent a mel spectrogram, which is a common representation of audio data used in audio processing and machine learning applications. It includes fields for the length of the data (`n_len`), the original length of the data (`n_len_org`), and the number of mel frequency bins (`n_mel`). The `data` field is a vector of floats that holds the actual mel spectrogram data, allowing for flexible storage and manipulation of the audio features.


---
### whisper\_filters<!-- {{#data_structure:whisper_preprocessor::whisper_filters}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `n_mel`: An integer representing the number of mel frequency bins.
    - `n_fft`: An integer representing the number of FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) points.
    - `data`: A vector of floats storing filter data.
- **Description**: The `whisper_filters` struct is designed to encapsulate filter parameters used in audio processing, specifically for mel frequency and FFT operations. It includes the number of mel frequency bins (`n_mel`), the number of FFT points (`n_fft`), and a vector of floating-point numbers (`data`) that holds the filter coefficients or data necessary for processing audio signals.
