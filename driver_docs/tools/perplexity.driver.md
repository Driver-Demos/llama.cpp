## Files
- **[CMakeLists.txt](perplexity/CMakeLists.txt.driver.md)**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file in `llama.cpp/tools/perplexity` configures the build process for the `llama-perplexity` executable, specifying source files, installation, library dependencies, and C++ standard requirements.
- **[perplexity.cpp](perplexity/perplexity.cpp.driver.md)**: The `perplexity.cpp` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase implements various functions for evaluating language models, including calculating perplexity, KL divergence, and scores for multiple-choice tasks like HellaSwag and Winogrande.
- **[README.md](perplexity/README.md.driver.md)**: The `README.md` file in the `llama.cpp/tools/perplexity` directory provides detailed instructions and explanations on how to use the `perplexity` example to calculate the perplexity value of language models, including comparisons between quantized and FP16 models, and additional statistics such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and token probability changes.
