## Files
- **[CMakeLists.txt](quantize/CMakeLists.txt.driver.md)**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file in `llama.cpp/tools/quantize` configures the build process for the `llama-quantize` executable, specifying source files, installation, library dependencies, include directories, and C++ standard requirements.
- **[quantize.cpp](quantize/quantize.cpp.driver.md)**: The `quantize.cpp` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase provides functionality for quantizing machine learning models, offering various quantization options and handling command-line arguments to customize the quantization process.
- **[README.md](quantize/README.md.driver.md)**: The `README.md` file in the `llama.cpp/tools/quantize` directory provides instructions and information on quantizing LLaMA models, including setup, usage examples, memory requirements, and supported quantization methods.
- **[tests.sh](quantize/tests.sh.driver.md)**: The `tests.sh` file is a shell script for testing the quantization process of models in the `llama.cpp` codebase, including steps for downloading, splitting, requantizing, and verifying the loading of models.
