# Purpose
This CMake configuration file defines the build instructions for the executable named "llama-bench." It specifies the source file "llama-bench.cpp" for the executable, installs the target as a runtime, links it with the libraries "common," "llama," and thread libraries, and enforces the use of C++17 standard features during compilation.
