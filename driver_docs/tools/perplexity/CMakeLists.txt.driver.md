# Purpose
This CMake configuration file defines the build instructions for an executable named "llama-perplexity" from the source file "perplexity.cpp". It specifies the installation of the executable, links it with the "common", "llama", and thread libraries, and enforces the use of the C++17 standard for compilation.
