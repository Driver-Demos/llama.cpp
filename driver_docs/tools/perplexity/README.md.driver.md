# Purpose
The provided content is a detailed documentation of a configuration file related to the evaluation of language models using the `perplexity` metric within the `llama.cpp` project. This file is primarily used to assess the performance and quality loss of language models, particularly when comparing quantized models to FP16 models. The documentation explains how perplexity is calculated and highlights the importance of using a consistent test set, such as Wikitext-2, for evaluation. It also describes the process of recording logits for further statistical analysis, including the calculation of Kullback-Leibler divergence to measure the similarity between different model distributions. The file includes extensive tables and comparisons of various quantization methods and their impact on model performance, providing insights into the trade-offs between model size and prediction accuracy. This configuration file is crucial for developers and researchers working on optimizing language models, as it provides a standardized method for evaluating and comparing model performance across different configurations.
# Content Summary
The provided document is a comprehensive guide on evaluating the perplexity of language models using the `perplexity` example within the `llama.cpp` framework. Perplexity is a metric used to assess how well a language model predicts the next token in a sequence, with lower values indicating better performance. However, perplexity values are not directly comparable across different models, especially if they employ different tokenizers. The document emphasizes that fine-tuning models often results in higher perplexity values, despite improvements in human-rated output quality.

The primary use of perplexity in `llama.cpp` is to evaluate the quality loss in base models when comparing quantized models to FP16 models. The Wikitext-2 test set is the standard dataset for testing, and results are typically generated with default command line arguments and compilation options unless specified otherwise. The document notes that `llama.cpp` perplexity values are not directly comparable to those from other projects due to implementation-specific details.

By default, the `perplexity` tool calculates the mean perplexity value and its uncertainty, assuming a Gaussian distribution of the "correct" logits and applying error propagation. Additional statistics can be obtained by recording logits from the FP16 version of a model using the `--kl-divergence-base` option, which saves logits in a binary format. This file can be large, with sizes reaching 11 GiB for LLaMA 2 and 37 GiB for LLaMA 3 when using the Wikitext-2 test set. The tool can also calculate the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, a measure of similarity between FP16 and quantized logit distributions, with a value of 0 indicating identical distributions.

The document provides detailed instructions on how to calculate various statistics, including the ratio and difference of mean FP16 and quantized perplexity, mean change in "correct" token probability, Pearson correlation coefficient, percentiles of change in token probability, root mean square of the change in token probabilities, and the percentage of times the same token is assigned the highest probability by both models. These metrics help assess the impact of quantization on model performance, distinguishing between noise and quality loss.

The document also includes a scoreboard for LLaMA 3 8b, comparing different quantization methods and their impact on perplexity and other metrics. It provides a comparison between LLaMA 2 and LLaMA 3 quantization, highlighting differences in mean perplexity, KL divergence, and other statistical measures. Additionally, a comparison between LLaMA 3 BF16 and FP16 is presented, showing minimal differences in performance metrics.

Overall, this document serves as a detailed reference for developers and researchers working with language models in `llama.cpp`, providing insights into evaluating model performance and the effects of quantization.
