# Purpose
This CMake configuration file defines the build process for the `llama-cvector-generator` executable. It specifies the source files `cvector-generator.cpp` and `pca.hpp`, sets the C++ standard to C++17, and links the executable with the `common`, `llama`, and thread libraries. Additionally, it includes instructions to install the runtime of the target.
