# Purpose
This C++ source code file defines a function within the `mean` namespace that calculates the mean and normalizes vectors stored in `ggml_tensor` structures. The function [`run`](#meanrun) takes two vectors of `ggml_tensor` pointers as input: `v_input` and `v_output`. Each element in `v_input` represents a tensor with a shape of `[n_embd, n_samples]`, where `n_embd` is the number of embeddings and `n_samples` is the number of samples. The function iterates over each tensor in `v_input`, computes the mean of each embedding across all samples, and stores the result in the corresponding tensor in `v_output`. After computing the mean, the function normalizes the output tensor by dividing each element by the vector's Euclidean norm.

The code is part of a larger system that likely involves machine learning or data processing, as indicated by the use of tensors and operations like mean calculation and normalization. The inclusion of headers such as "common.h", "llama.h", and "ggml.h" suggests that this file is part of a broader library or application, possibly related to neural networks or similar computational tasks. The function does not define a public API or external interface but rather provides a specific utility within the context of the system, focusing on tensor manipulation and mathematical operations.

# Functions

---
### run<!-- {{#callable:mean::run}} -->
The `run` function calculates the mean and normalizes each input tensor in a vector of tensors, storing the results in a corresponding output vector of tensors.
- **Inputs**:
    - `v_input`: A vector of pointers to ggml_tensor structures, where each tensor has a shape of [n_embd, n_samples].
    - `v_output`: A vector of pointers to ggml_tensor structures, intended to store the mean and normalized results of the corresponding input tensors.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Prints a message indicating the start of the mean calculation process.
    - Iterates over each tensor in the `v_input` vector.
    - For each input tensor, prepares the corresponding output tensor and formats its name.
    - Calculates the mean of each element across the second dimension of the input tensor and stores it in the output tensor.
    - Asserts that the number of elements in the first dimension of the input tensor matches that of the output tensor.
    - Normalizes the output tensor by calculating the L2 norm and dividing each element by this norm.
    - Prints a message indicating the completion of processing for each layer.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `v_output` tensors in place to contain the mean and normalized values of the corresponding `v_input` tensors.
