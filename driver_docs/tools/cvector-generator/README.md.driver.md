# Purpose
The provided content is a documentation snippet for a tool called `cvector-generator`, which is used to generate control vectors using gguf models, specifically within the context of the `llama.cpp` project. The document outlines various command-line examples demonstrating how to execute the `cvector-generator` with different configurations, such as running on CPU or GPU, using advanced options like PCA iterations, or employing alternative methods like mean value. It also provides tips for handling multi-line prompts by escaping newline characters and offers guidance on integrating the generated control vectors with the `llama-cli` tool, emphasizing the effectiveness of applying control vectors to higher layers. Additionally, the document references related pull requests and issues, providing context and linking to further development discussions and enhancements related to control vector generation.
