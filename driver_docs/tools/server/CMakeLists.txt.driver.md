# Purpose
The provided content is a CMake configuration file used to define the build process for a software project named "llama-server." This file specifies various build options and dependencies, such as enabling SSL support through the `LLAMA_SERVER_SSL` option, which is disabled by default. It includes directories for source and binary files and handles platform-specific configurations, such as setting compile definitions for Windows using MinGW. The file lists source files and public assets, converting the latter into header files using a custom command. It then defines the executable target, links necessary libraries, and sets the C++ standard to C++17, ensuring the build process is tailored to the project's requirements and environment.
