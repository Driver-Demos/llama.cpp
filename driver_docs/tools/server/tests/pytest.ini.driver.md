# Purpose
The file is a configuration for the pytest testing framework, defining custom markers for test categorization. It specifies a "slow" marker to label tests as slow, allowing them to be excluded from test runs using the '-m "not slow"' option, and a "serial" marker, which is likely used to categorize tests that should be run in a specific sequence.
