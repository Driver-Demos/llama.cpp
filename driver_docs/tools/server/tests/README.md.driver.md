# Purpose
The provided content is a documentation snippet for running server tests using the `pytest` framework in a Python-based environment. It outlines the process for setting up and executing tests on a server, specifically targeting GitHub workflow job runners with a 4 vCPU configuration. The document includes instructions for installing necessary dependencies, building the server, and executing tests, with options to customize the test scenarios using environment variables. These variables allow users to modify server settings such as the listening port, server binary path, and verbosity for debugging purposes. Additionally, it provides guidance on running slow tests, enabling real-time output for debugging, and executing specific test files or individual tests. The document serves as a comprehensive guide for developers to efficiently test server functionalities in a controlled environment.
