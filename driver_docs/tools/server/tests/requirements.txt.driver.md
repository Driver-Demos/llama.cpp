# Purpose
The file is a Python `requirements.txt` file that specifies the dependencies for a Python project. Each line lists a package with a version constraint using the `~=` operator, which indicates compatibility with the specified version, allowing for updates that do not change the leftmost non-zero digit. This ensures that the project uses compatible versions of the listed libraries, such as `aiohttp`, `pytest`, and `numpy`, among others.
