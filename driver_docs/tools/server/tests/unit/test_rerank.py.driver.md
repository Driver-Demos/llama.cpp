# Purpose
This Python script is a test suite using the `pytest` framework to validate the functionality of a server-based reranking system, likely part of a machine learning or natural language processing application. The code defines several test cases to ensure that the server correctly processes and ranks documents based on a given query, using a predefined set of test documents. It includes tests for valid reranking requests, checks for correct ranking order, and handles various invalid input scenarios to ensure robustness. The script also verifies the server's response structure and token usage, indicating a focus on both functional correctness and performance metrics. This code provides narrow functionality, specifically targeting the testing of a reranking server's API endpoints.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `pytest`
- `utils.*`


# Global Variables

---
### server
- **Type**: `ServerPreset`
- **Description**: The `server` variable is an instance of the `ServerPreset` class, specifically initialized with the `jina_reranker_tiny` preset. This suggests that it is configured to perform reranking tasks, likely using a small, predefined model or configuration for processing requests.
- **Use**: The `server` variable is used to handle reranking requests in the test functions, where it is started and then used to make HTTP POST requests to the `/rerank` endpoint with various data payloads.


---
### TEST\_DOCUMENTS
- **Type**: `list`
- **Description**: `TEST_DOCUMENTS` is a list of strings, where each string represents a document or a piece of text. The list contains four entries, each providing a brief description or definition related to topics such as machines, learning, machine learning, and a description of Paris in French.
- **Use**: This variable is used as input data for testing the reranking functionality of a server, where the documents are ranked based on their relevance to a given query.


# Functions

---
### create\_server<!-- {{#callable:llama.cpp/tools/server/tests/unit/test_rerank.create_server}} -->
The `create_server` function is a pytest fixture that initializes a global server instance using a predefined server preset for testing purposes.
- **Decorators**: `@pytest.fixture`
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is decorated with `@pytest.fixture` with `scope='module'` and `autouse=True`, meaning it runs automatically once per module.
    - It sets the global variable `server` to an instance of `ServerPreset.jina_reranker_tiny()`.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it initializes the global `server` variable.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`llama.cpp/tools/server/tests/utils.ServerPreset.jina_reranker_tiny`](../utils.py.driver.md#ServerPresetjina_reranker_tiny)


---
### test\_rerank<!-- {{#callable:llama.cpp/tools/server/tests/unit/test_rerank.test_rerank}} -->
The `test_rerank` function tests the reranking functionality of a server by sending a POST request with a query and documents, and then verifies the response for correct status, result count, and relevance ordering.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Start the server using `server.start()`.
    - Make a POST request to the `/rerank` endpoint with a query and a list of documents.
    - Assert that the response status code is 200, indicating success.
    - Assert that the number of results in the response body is 4.
    - Initialize `most_relevant` and `least_relevant` with the first result from the response.
    - Iterate over the results to find the document with the highest and lowest relevance scores.
    - Assert that the most relevant document has a higher relevance score than the least relevant document.
    - Assert that the index of the most relevant document is 2 and the least relevant document is 3.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it uses assertions to validate the server's reranking functionality.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`llama.cpp/tools/server/tests/utils.ServerProcess.start`](../utils.py.driver.md#ServerProcessstart)
    - [`llama.cpp/tools/server/tests/utils.ServerProcess.make_request`](../utils.py.driver.md#ServerProcessmake_request)


---
### test\_rerank\_tei\_format<!-- {{#callable:llama.cpp/tools/server/tests/unit/test_rerank.test_rerank_tei_format}} -->
The function `test_rerank_tei_format` tests the reranking functionality of a server by sending a POST request with a query and documents, and verifies the response for correct ranking order and indices.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The server is started using `server.start()`.
    - A POST request is made to the `/rerank` endpoint with a query and a list of documents.
    - The response status code is asserted to be 200, indicating a successful request.
    - The length of the response body is asserted to be 4, ensuring all documents are processed.
    - The first document in the response is initially assumed to be both the most and least relevant.
    - The function iterates over the response body to find the document with the highest and lowest scores.
    - Assertions are made to ensure the most relevant document has a higher score than the least relevant.
    - The indices of the most and least relevant documents are asserted to be 2 and 3, respectively.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it uses assertions to validate the server's reranking functionality.
- **Functions called**:

### test\_invalid\_rerank\_req<!-- {{#callable:llama.cpp/tools/server/tests/unit/test_rerank.test_invalid_rerank_req}} -->
The function `test_invalid_rerank_req` tests the server's response to invalid document inputs for a rerank request, ensuring it returns a 400 status code and an error message.
- **Decorators**: `@pytest.mark.parametrize`
- **Inputs**:
    - `documents`: A parameterized input representing various invalid document inputs, such as an empty list, None, a number, or a list of numbers.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function starts the global server instance.
    - It makes a POST request to the '/rerank' endpoint with a fixed query and the parameterized 'documents' input.
    - The function asserts that the response status code is 400, indicating a bad request.
    - It also asserts that the response body contains an 'error' key, confirming the presence of an error message.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it uses assertions to validate the server's response to invalid inputs.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`llama.cpp/tools/server/tests/utils.ServerProcess.start`](../utils.py.driver.md#ServerProcessstart)
