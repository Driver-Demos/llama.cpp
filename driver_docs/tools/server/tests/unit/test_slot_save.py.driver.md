# Purpose
This Python file is a test suite designed to validate the functionality of a server, specifically focusing on the server's ability to handle slot-based operations such as saving, restoring, and erasing cached data. The code uses the `pytest` framework to define and execute tests, ensuring that the server behaves as expected when processing requests related to text completion tasks. The server is instantiated using a preset configuration, `ServerPreset.tinyllama2()`, which suggests it is a specific setup of a server, possibly related to a language model or similar service.

The test suite includes two primary test functions: [`test_slot_save_restore`](#cpp/tools/server/tests/unit/test_slot_savetest_slot_save_restore) and [`test_slot_erase`](#cpp/tools/server/tests/unit/test_slot_savetest_slot_erase). The [`test_slot_save_restore`](#cpp/tools/server/tests/unit/test_slot_savetest_slot_save_restore) function verifies that the server can save the state of a slot to a file, restore it to another slot, and continue processing requests with cached data efficiently. The [`test_slot_erase`](#cpp/tools/server/tests/unit/test_slot_savetest_slot_erase) function checks that the server can erase a slot's data and subsequently process a request from scratch, without relying on previously cached data. These tests ensure that the server's slot management features work correctly, maintaining data integrity and optimizing processing through caching mechanisms. The use of global variables and server requests indicates that the code is intended to be run in an environment where the server is accessible and can handle HTTP requests.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `pytest`
- `utils.*`


# Global Variables

---
### server
- **Type**: `ServerPreset`
- **Description**: The `server` variable is an instance of the `ServerPreset` class, specifically initialized with the `tinyllama2` configuration. This setup is likely a predefined server configuration used for testing purposes.
- **Use**: The `server` variable is used to manage server operations such as starting the server, handling requests, and managing slots for testing server functionalities.


# Functions

---
### create\_server<!-- {{#callable:llama.cpp/tools/server/tests/unit/test_slot_save.create_server}} -->
The `create_server` function is a pytest fixture that initializes a global server instance with specific configurations for testing purposes.
- **Decorators**: `@pytest.fixture`
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is decorated with `@pytest.fixture` with `scope="module"` and `autouse=True`, meaning it will automatically run once per module before any tests are executed.
    - A global variable `server` is set to a new instance of `ServerPreset.tinyllama2()`.
    - The `slot_save_path` attribute of the server is set to "./tmp".
    - The `temperature` attribute of the server is set to 0.0.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it sets up a global server instance for use in tests.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`llama.cpp/tools/server/tests/utils.ServerPreset.tinyllama2`](../utils.py.driver.md#ServerPresettinyllama2)

### test\_slot\_save\_restore<!-- {{#callable:llama.cpp/tools/server/tests/unit/test_slot_save.test_slot_save_restore}} -->
The `test_slot_save_restore` function tests the functionality of saving and restoring server state slots, ensuring that cached prompts are processed correctly and that slot data integrity is maintained.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The server is started using `server.start()`.
    - A POST request is made to the `/completion` endpoint with a prompt about France, using slot 1, and caching enabled; the response is checked for a 200 status code, specific content pattern, and full token processing.
    - A POST request is made to save the state of slot 1 to a file named `slot1.bin`; the response is checked for a 200 status code and the number of saved items.
    - A POST request is made to the `/completion` endpoint with a prompt about Germany, using slot 1, and caching enabled; the response is checked for a 200 status code, specific content pattern, and partial token processing due to caching.
    - A POST request is made to restore the saved state into slot 0 from `slot1.bin`; the response is checked for a 200 status code and the number of restored items.
    - A POST request is made to the `/completion` endpoint with a prompt about Germany, using slot 0, and caching enabled; the response is checked for a 200 status code, specific content pattern, and partial token processing due to caching.
    - A POST request is made again to the `/completion` endpoint with a prompt about Germany, using slot 1, and caching enabled; the response is checked for a 200 status code, specific content pattern, and minimal token processing to verify slot 1 integrity.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it uses assertions to validate the expected behavior of the server's slot save and restore functionality.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`llama.cpp/tools/server/tests/utils.ServerProcess.start`](../utils.py.driver.md#ServerProcessstart)
    - [`llama.cpp/tools/server/tests/utils.ServerProcess.make_request`](../utils.py.driver.md#ServerProcessmake_request)
    - [`llama.cpp/tools/server/tests/utils.match_regex`](../utils.py.driver.md#cpp/tools/server/tests/utilsmatch_regex)

### test\_slot\_erase<!-- {{#callable:llama.cpp/tools/server/tests/unit/test_slot_save.test_slot_erase}} -->
The `test_slot_erase` function tests the erasure of a server slot and verifies that a prompt is fully reprocessed after the slot is erased.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Start the server using `server.start()`.
    - Make a POST request to `/completion` with a prompt, slot ID, and cache setting, and assert the response status and content match expected values.
    - Make a POST request to `/slots/1?action=erase` to erase the slot and assert the response status is 200.
    - Re-run the same prompt with the same slot ID and cache setting, and assert the response status and content match expected values, ensuring all tokens are processed again.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it uses assertions to validate the expected behavior of the server's slot erasure and prompt processing.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`llama.cpp/tools/server/tests/utils.ServerProcess.start`](../utils.py.driver.md#ServerProcessstart)
    - [`llama.cpp/tools/server/tests/utils.ServerProcess.make_request`](../utils.py.driver.md#ServerProcessmake_request)
    - [`llama.cpp/tools/server/tests/utils.match_regex`](../utils.py.driver.md#cpp/tools/server/tests/utilsmatch_regex)
