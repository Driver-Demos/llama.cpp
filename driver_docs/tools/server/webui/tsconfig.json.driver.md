# Purpose
This JSON file is a TypeScript configuration file, likely named `tsconfig.json`, which specifies project-wide compiler options and file references. It includes an empty "files" array, indicating no specific files are directly included, and a "references" array that points to two other TypeScript configuration files, `tsconfig.app.json` and `tsconfig.node.json`, enabling project references for modular TypeScript projects.
