# Purpose
The provided JSON content is a TypeScript configuration file, typically named `tsconfig.json`, which is used to specify the compiler options for a TypeScript project. The `compilerOptions` object defines various settings that influence the TypeScript compiler's behavior. Key options include setting the target ECMAScript version to ES2021, enabling the use of `define` for class fields, and specifying libraries such as ES2021 and DOM for type checking. The configuration also sets the module system to ESNext and enforces strict type-checking rules, such as disallowing unused locals and parameters, and ensuring no fallthrough cases in switch statements. Additionally, the `include` array specifies that the TypeScript compiler should only consider files within the `src` directory for compilation.
