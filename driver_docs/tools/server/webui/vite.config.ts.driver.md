# Purpose
The provided code is a configuration file for Vite, a build tool for modern web projects, specifically tailored for a React application. It defines a configuration using `defineConfig` that includes plugins for building the frontend, such as the React plugin and a custom plugin for creating a single file build. The custom plugin, `llamaCppPlugin`, is responsible for compressing the generated `index.html` file using gzip, ensuring the output is within a specified maximum bundle size, and writing the compressed file to a target directory. The configuration also sets up a development server with specific proxy rules and security headers to manage cross-origin policies. This setup facilitates efficient development and optimized production builds for the frontend application.
