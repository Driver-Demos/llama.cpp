# Purpose
This code defines a React component and context for managing modal dialogs within a React application. It provides a `ModalProvider` component that wraps its children with a context provider, allowing any component within its tree to access modal functionalities. The primary purpose of this file is to facilitate the display and management of three types of modals: confirm, prompt, and alert. These modals are implemented using the HTML `<dialog>` element and are styled with CSS classes. The modals are controlled through state management using React's `useState` hook, and they are triggered by functions that return promises, allowing for asynchronous handling of user interactions.

The `ModalContext` is created using React's `createContext` and is typed with `ModalContextType`, which defines three functions: `showConfirm`, `showPrompt`, and `showAlert`. These functions are responsible for opening the respective modals and returning promises that resolve based on user actions. The state for each modal type is managed separately, with each state containing properties such as `isOpen`, `message`, and `resolve`. The `resolve` function is used to fulfill the promise when the user interacts with the modal, such as clicking a button or pressing the Enter key.

The file also exports a `useModals` hook, which provides a convenient way for components to access the modal functions. This hook ensures that it is used within the `ModalProvider` by checking the context and throwing an error if the context is not available. Overall, this code provides a reusable and centralized solution for handling modal dialogs in a React application, promoting consistency and ease of use across different components.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `React`
- `createContext`
- `useState`
- `useContext`


# Global Variables

### ModalContext
- **Type**: `React.Context<ModalContextType>`
- **Description**: `ModalContext` is a React context object that provides a way to pass modal-related functions (`showConfirm`, `showPrompt`, and `showAlert`) down the component tree without having to pass props explicitly at every level. It is initialized with a type `ModalContextType`, which defines the structure of the context value, including methods for displaying different types of modals.
- **Use**: `ModalContext` is used to provide modal functions to components within the `ModalProvider` component, allowing them to trigger modals without prop drilling.


# Data Structures

---
### ModalState
- **Type**: `interface`
- **Members**:
    - `isOpen`: A boolean indicating whether the modal is currently open.
    - `message`: A string containing the message to be displayed in the modal.
    - `defaultValue`: An optional string representing the default value for input fields in the modal.
    - `resolve`: A function or null, used to resolve the promise associated with the modal's action.
- **Description**: The `ModalState` interface is a TypeScript data structure used to manage the state of modal dialogs in a React application. It includes properties to track whether the modal is open, the message to display, an optional default value for input fields, and a resolve function to handle the completion of the modal's promise-based actions. This interface is utilized within the `ModalProvider` component to manage different types of modals such as confirm, prompt, and alert dialogs.


# Functions

---
### ModalProvider
The ModalProvider component provides a context for managing and displaying modal dialogs for confirmation, prompts, and alerts in a React application.
- **Inputs**:
    - `children`: A React node that represents the child components to be wrapped by the ModalProvider.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize state for confirm, prompt, and alert modals using useState, each with properties isOpen, message, and resolve.
    - Define showConfirm, showPrompt, and showAlert functions that update the respective modal state to open and set the message and resolve function.
    - Define handleConfirm, handlePrompt, and handleAlertClose functions to resolve the promise and reset the modal state to closed.
    - Render the ModalContext.Provider with the showConfirm, showPrompt, and showAlert functions as its value, wrapping the children components.
    - Conditionally render dialog elements for confirm, prompt, and alert modals based on their isOpen state, with buttons to handle user actions and close the modals.
- **Output**: A React component that provides a context with functions to show confirmation, prompt, and alert modals, and renders the children components within this context.


---
### showConfirm
The `showConfirm` function displays a confirmation modal with a message and returns a promise that resolves to a boolean based on user interaction.
- **Inputs**:
    - `message`: A string representing the message to be displayed in the confirmation modal.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function returns a new Promise.
    - The `setConfirmState` function is called to update the state, setting `isOpen` to true, storing the `message`, and assigning the `resolve` function of the promise.
    - The modal is displayed to the user with the provided message.
    - User interaction with the modal (either confirming or canceling) triggers the `handleConfirm` function, which resolves the promise with the appropriate boolean value and resets the state.
- **Output**: A Promise that resolves to a boolean value, indicating whether the user confirmed (true) or canceled (false) the action.


---
### showPrompt
The `showPrompt` function displays a prompt modal with a message and an optional default value, returning a promise that resolves to the user's input or undefined if canceled.
- **Inputs**:
    - `message`: A string representing the message to be displayed in the prompt modal.
    - `defaultValue`: An optional string representing the default value to be pre-filled in the input field of the prompt modal.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function returns a new Promise.
    - The `setPromptState` function is called to update the state, setting `isOpen` to true, and storing the `message`, `defaultValue`, and `resolve` function.
    - The modal is displayed with the message and input field pre-filled with `defaultValue` if provided.
    - The user can either submit the input or cancel the prompt.
    - If the user submits, the `handlePrompt` function is called with the input value, resolving the promise with the input.
    - If the user cancels, the `handlePrompt` function is called without a value, resolving the promise with `undefined`.
- **Output**: A Promise that resolves to a string containing the user's input or `undefined` if the prompt is canceled.


---
### showAlert
The `showAlert` function displays an alert modal with a given message and returns a promise that resolves when the alert is closed.
- **Inputs**:
    - `message`: A string representing the message to be displayed in the alert modal.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function returns a new Promise.
    - The `setAlertState` function is called to update the alert state, setting `isOpen` to true, `message` to the provided message, and `resolve` to the promise's resolve function.
    - The promise resolves when the `handleAlertClose` function is called, which is triggered by the user closing the alert modal.
- **Output**: A Promise that resolves with no value when the alert modal is closed.


---
### handleConfirm
The `handleConfirm` function resolves the promise associated with a confirmation modal and resets its state.
- **Inputs**:
    - `result`: A boolean value indicating the user's response to the confirmation modal, either true for confirm or false for cancel.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the `resolve` function in `confirmState` is not null and call it with the `result` argument.
    - Reset the `confirmState` to its initial state with `isOpen` set to false, `message` as an empty string, and `resolve` as null.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value.


---
### handlePrompt
The `handlePrompt` function resolves the prompt modal's promise with the provided result and resets the prompt state.
- **Inputs**:
    - `result`: An optional string representing the user's input from the prompt modal.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the `resolve` function in `promptState` is defined and call it with the `result` argument.
    - Reset the `promptState` to its initial state with `isOpen` set to `false`, `message` as an empty string, and `resolve` as `null`.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value.


---
### handleAlertClose
The `handleAlertClose` function resolves the alert modal's promise and resets its state to closed.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Checks if the `resolve` function in `alertState` is defined and calls it to resolve the promise associated with the alert modal.
    - Updates the `alertState` to set `isOpen` to `false`, `message` to an empty string, and `resolve` to `null`, effectively closing the alert modal.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value.


---
### useModals
The `useModals` function provides access to modal dialog functions within a React component, ensuring they are used within a `ModalProvider` context.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls `useContext` with `ModalContext` to retrieve the modal functions from the context.
    - It checks if the context is null, and if so, throws an error indicating that `useModals` must be used within a `ModalProvider`.
    - If the context is valid, it returns the context, which contains the modal functions `showConfirm`, `showPrompt`, and `showAlert`.
- **Output**: The function returns the modal context, which includes the functions `showConfirm`, `showPrompt`, and `showAlert` for displaying different types of modals.
