# Purpose
This code is a React component utility file that provides a specific functionality related to scrolling behavior in a chat application. It defines a function `scrollToBottom` that automatically scrolls a specified element to the bottom, with an optional delay, and a `useChatScroll` custom hook that leverages this function to ensure that a chat message list stays scrolled to the bottom as new messages are added. The `useChatScroll` hook uses the `ResizeObserver` API to detect changes in the size of the message list and applies throttling to optimize performance, using a utility function `throttle` imported from another module. This file is intended to be imported and used within other components of a React application, specifically those dealing with chat interfaces, to enhance user experience by maintaining the scroll position at the bottom of the chat window.

# Functions

### scrollToBottom
The `scrollToBottom` function scrolls a specified element to the bottom, optionally only if it is near the bottom, with a configurable delay.
- **Inputs**:
    - `requiresNearBottom`: A boolean indicating whether the scroll should only occur if the element is near the bottom.
    - `delay`: An optional number specifying the delay in milliseconds before the scroll action is executed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the DOM element with the ID 'main-scroll'.
    - If the element is not found, exit the function.
    - Calculate the space between the current scroll position and the bottom of the element.
    - If `requiresNearBottom` is false or the space to the bottom is less than 100 pixels, schedule a scroll to the bottom of the element after the specified delay (defaulting to 80 milliseconds if not provided).
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs a side effect by scrolling the specified element.

### useChatScroll
The `useChatScroll` function is a React hook that automatically scrolls a chat message list to the bottom when new messages are added or the list is resized.
- **Inputs**:
    - `msgListRef`: A React ref object pointing to the HTMLDivElement that contains the chat message list.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses the `useEffect` hook to perform side effects related to the chat message list.
    - Inside `useEffect`, it checks if `msgListRef.current` is defined; if not, it returns early.
    - A `ResizeObserver` is created to observe changes in the size of the chat message list element.
    - The `ResizeObserver` is set to call `scrollToBottomThrottled` with parameters `true` and `10` whenever the observed element is resized.
    - The `ResizeObserver` is attached to the current element of `msgListRef`.
    - The `useEffect` cleanup function disconnects the `ResizeObserver` when the component unmounts or `msgListRef` changes.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it sets up a side effect to manage scrolling behavior.
