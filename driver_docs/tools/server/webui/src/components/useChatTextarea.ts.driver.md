# Purpose
This code defines a custom React hook named `useChatTextarea`, which is designed to manage the behavior and appearance of a textarea element, particularly in chat applications. The hook provides an API that includes methods for getting and setting the textarea's value, focusing the textarea, and handling input events. It also includes a reference to the textarea element and a mutable reference for a submit handler. The primary functionality of this hook is to automatically adjust the height of the textarea based on its content, but only on large screens, as defined by a media query. This ensures that the textarea expands to fit its content without exceeding a specified maximum height, enhancing the user experience by maintaining a clean and responsive interface.

The hook utilizes several React features, such as `useState`, `useRef`, `useEffect`, and `useCallback`, to manage state and side effects efficiently. The `useEffect` hook is used to set the initial value and adjust the height of the textarea when the component mounts or when the initial value changes. The `useCallback` hook is employed to create a stable input handler function that adjusts the textarea's height whenever the user inputs text. The `throttle` function from a utility module is used to limit the frequency of height adjustments, preventing performance issues from excessive DOM manipulations.

Overall, this code provides a focused and reusable solution for managing textarea elements in React applications, particularly those that require dynamic resizing based on content. It encapsulates the logic for handling textarea behavior in a single hook, making it easy to integrate into larger applications while maintaining a clean separation of concerns.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `useEffect`
- `useRef`
- `useState`
- `useCallback`
- `throttle`
- `React`


# Global Variables

---
### LARGE\_SCREEN\_MQ
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `LARGE_SCREEN_MQ` variable is a string that defines a media query for detecting large screens, specifically those with a minimum width of 1024 pixels. This corresponds to the 'lg:' breakpoint in Tailwind CSS, which is commonly used to apply styles for larger screens.
- **Use**: This variable is used to determine if the current screen size matches the large screen criteria, allowing conditional logic to be applied based on screen size.


# Data Structures

---
### ChatTextareaApi
- **Type**: `Interface`
- **Members**:
    - `value`: A function that returns the current value of the textarea as a string.
    - `setValue`: A function that sets the value of the textarea and adjusts its height.
    - `focus`: A function that focuses the textarea element.
    - `ref`: A React ref object pointing to the HTMLTextAreaElement.
    - `refOnSubmit`: A mutable React ref object for a submit handler function.
    - `onInput`: A function handling input events to adjust the textarea height.
- **Description**: The `ChatTextareaApi` is an interface that defines the API for managing a chat textarea element in a React application. It provides methods to get and set the textarea's value, focus the textarea, and handle input events to dynamically adjust the textarea's height based on its content. The interface also includes references to the textarea element and a submit handler, facilitating integration with other components and ensuring the textarea's appearance adapts to different screen sizes.


# Functions

---
### useChatTextarea
The `useChatTextarea` function is a custom React hook that manages a textarea element's value, focus, and dynamic height adjustment based on screen size.
- **Inputs**:
    - `initValue`: A string representing the initial value to be set in the textarea.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize state `savedInitValue` with `initValue` and create refs for the textarea and submit handler.
    - Use `useEffect` to set the textarea's initial value and adjust its height on mount or when `initValue` changes.
    - Define `handleInput` using `useCallback` to adjust the textarea's height on input events.
    - Return an object containing methods to get and set the textarea's value, focus the textarea, and handle input events.
- **Output**: An object implementing the `ChatTextareaApi` interface, providing methods and refs for managing the textarea's value, focus, and input handling.
