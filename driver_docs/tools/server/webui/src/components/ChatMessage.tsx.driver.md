# Purpose
The provided code defines a React component named `ChatMessage`, which is part of a chat application interface. This component is responsible for rendering individual chat messages, handling both user and assistant roles. It includes functionality for displaying message content, editing messages, navigating between different versions of a message, and showing additional context or metadata such as message timings. The component uses several imported utilities and components, such as `MarkdownDisplay` for rendering message content in markdown format, and `BtnWithTooltips` for interactive buttons with tooltips.

The `ChatMessage` component is designed to handle both pending and completed messages, with specific logic to manage the display of messages that are still being generated. It uses React hooks like `useState` and `useMemo` to manage state and optimize performance, particularly in calculating message timings and splitting message content into different parts, such as content and thought processes. The component also provides user interaction features, such as editing message content and regenerating assistant responses, which are facilitated through callback functions passed as props.

Additionally, the code includes a helper component, `ThoughtProcess`, which is used to display the thought process of the assistant when applicable. This component allows users to toggle the visibility of the thought process content, enhancing the interactivity and usability of the chat interface. Overall, the `ChatMessage` component is a crucial part of the chat application's user interface, providing a comprehensive and interactive way to display and manage chat messages.

# Data Structures

---
### SplitMessage
- **Type**: `interface`
- **Members**:
    - `content`: Holds the main content of the pending message.
    - `thought`: Optional field that contains the thought process or reasoning behind the message.
    - `isThinking`: Optional boolean indicating if the system is currently processing or 'thinking' about the message.
- **Description**: The `SplitMessage` interface is designed to represent a message that has been divided into its main content and an optional thought process. This structure is particularly useful for systems that need to display both the message content and the reasoning or thought process behind it, such as in AI or chatbot applications. The `isThinking` field indicates whether the system is actively processing the message, allowing for dynamic UI updates to reflect the system's state.


# Functions

---
### ChatMessage
The `ChatMessage` function renders a chat message component with editing, navigation, and display functionalities for user and assistant messages, including handling pending states and thought processes.
- **Inputs**:
    - `msg`: A `Message` or `PendingMessage` object representing the chat message to be displayed.
    - `siblingLeafNodeIds`: An array of message IDs representing sibling messages for navigation purposes.
    - `siblingCurrIdx`: A number indicating the current index of the message among its siblings.
    - `id`: An optional string representing the unique identifier for the message component.
    - `onRegenerateMessage`: A function to be called to regenerate the message content.
    - `onEditMessage`: A function to be called to edit the message content.
    - `onChangeSibling`: A function to be called to change the current sibling message.
    - `isPending`: An optional boolean indicating if the message is in a pending state.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve `viewingChat` and `config` from the application context using `useAppContext`.
    - Initialize `editingContent` state to manage the editing state of the message content.
    - Compute `timings` using `useMemo` to calculate token processing speeds if `msg.timings` is available.
    - Determine `nextSibling` and `prevSibling` based on `siblingLeafNodeIds` and `siblingCurrIdx`.
    - Use `useMemo` to split the message content into `content`, `thought`, and `isThinking` if the message role is 'assistant' and contains '<think>' tags.
    - Return `null` if `viewingChat` is false, indicating the chat is not being viewed.
    - Determine if the message is from a user by checking `msg.role`.
    - Render the message component with different styles and functionalities based on whether the message is from a user or assistant.
    - Provide editing capabilities for user messages and regeneration options for assistant messages.
    - Display message content as markdown and handle pending states with loading indicators.
    - Render navigation controls for sibling messages if multiple versions exist.
    - Display token processing speeds if enabled in the configuration.
- **Output**: A JSX element representing the chat message component with various interactive features based on the message type and state.


---
### ThoughtProcess
The `ThoughtProcess` function renders a collapsible UI component to display the thought process of an assistant message, with an option to show a loading spinner if the process is ongoing.
- **Inputs**:
    - `isThinking`: A boolean indicating whether the thought process is currently ongoing, which affects the display of a loading spinner.
    - `content`: A string containing the thought process content to be displayed.
    - `open`: A boolean indicating whether the thought process display should be initially open or collapsed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function returns a JSX element that represents a collapsible UI component.
    - The component includes a checkbox input to control the open/closed state of the collapsible section, with its default state determined by the 'open' prop.
    - A button is rendered with text that changes based on the 'isThinking' prop; it shows a loading spinner and 'Thinking' text if 'isThinking' is true, otherwise it shows 'Thought Process'.
    - The collapsible content section contains the 'content' prop rendered using the 'MarkdownDisplay' component, which is styled with a border and padding.
- **Output**: A JSX element representing a collapsible UI component for displaying the thought process of an assistant message.
