# Purpose
The provided code is a React component file that primarily focuses on rendering and processing Markdown content with support for LaTeX and code blocks. The main component, `MarkdownDisplay`, utilizes the `react-markdown` library to render Markdown content, enhanced with plugins like `remark-gfm` for GitHub Flavored Markdown, `remark-math` for mathematical expressions, and `rehype-katex` for rendering LaTeX. The component also integrates a custom plugin, `rehypeCustomCopyButton`, which injects a button element before each code block to facilitate copying or executing code snippets. This functionality is further supported by the `CodeBlockButtons` component, which conditionally renders buttons for copying code or running Python code, depending on the configuration and content.

The file includes several utility functions for processing LaTeX and code blocks within the Markdown content. Functions like `processLaTeX` and `preprocessLaTeX` are responsible for identifying and protecting LaTeX expressions and code blocks, ensuring they are correctly rendered and not misinterpreted as currency or other non-LaTeX content. These functions use regular expressions to detect and replace LaTeX delimiters and escape certain characters, maintaining the integrity of the content during rendering.

Overall, this file provides a specialized component for displaying Markdown content with advanced features like LaTeX rendering and code block manipulation. It is designed to be part of a larger application, likely a documentation or educational tool, where users can view and interact with Markdown content that includes mathematical expressions and executable code snippets. The file is structured to be reusable and extendable, with clear separation of concerns between rendering, processing, and user interaction components.

# Functions

---
### MarkdownDisplay
The `MarkdownDisplay` function renders markdown content with support for LaTeX, code highlighting, and custom buttons for copying and running code blocks.
- **Inputs**:
    - `content`: A string containing the markdown content to be rendered.
    - `isGenerating`: An optional boolean indicating if content is being generated, affecting the display and functionality of code execution buttons.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses `useMemo` to preprocess LaTeX content from the `content` input, ensuring efficient re-renders.
    - It returns a `Markdown` component configured with plugins for GitHub-flavored markdown, math support, and custom copy button functionality.
    - The `components` prop of `Markdown` is customized to replace `button` elements with `CodeBlockButtons`, which handle code copying and execution.
    - The `CodeBlockButtons` component determines the code language and whether code execution is possible based on the `isGenerating` flag and application context.
    - If code execution is possible, a `RunPyCodeButton` is rendered alongside a `CopyButton` for each code block.
- **Output**: The function outputs a React component that renders the processed markdown content with interactive buttons for code blocks.


---
### rehypeCustomCopyButton
The `rehypeCustomCopyButton` function modifies a Markdown AST to insert a button element before each code block for custom rendering in a React component.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function returns another function that takes a Markdown AST tree as input.
    - It uses the `visit` utility to traverse the tree and find nodes of type 'element'.
    - For each 'pre' element node that hasn't been visited, it creates a copy of the node and marks it as visited.
    - The original node is transformed into a 'div' element with no properties.
    - A new 'button' element node is created and inserted as a child of the transformed 'div' node, followed by the original 'pre' node.
- **Output**: The function outputs a modified Markdown AST with 'button' elements inserted before each 'pre' element.


---
### processLaTeX
The `processLaTeX` function processes a string containing LaTeX expressions by temporarily replacing code blocks with placeholders, escaping certain characters, and converting LaTeX expressions to a markdown-compatible format.
- **Inputs**:
    - `_content`: A string containing LaTeX expressions and possibly code blocks that need to be processed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a variable `content` with the input `_content`.
    - Create an empty array `codeBlocks` to store code blocks temporarily.
    - Replace code blocks and inline code in `content` with placeholders and store them in `codeBlocks`.
    - Escape dollar signs followed by a digit or space and digit in `content`.
    - Check if `processedContent` contains any LaTeX patterns using `containsLatexRegex`.
    - If no LaTeX patterns are found, restore code blocks and return the processed content.
    - Convert inline and block LaTeX expressions to a markdown-compatible format using `inlineLatex` and `blockLatex` regex patterns.
    - Restore code blocks in `processedContent` using the `restoreCodeBlocks` function.
    - Return the final processed content.
- **Output**: A string with LaTeX expressions converted to a markdown-compatible format and code blocks restored.

### preprocessLaTeX
The `preprocessLaTeX` function processes a string containing LaTeX expressions by protecting code blocks, escaping certain characters, and restoring LaTeX expressions to ensure proper formatting.
- **Inputs**:
    - `content`: A string containing LaTeX expressions and possibly code blocks that need to be processed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize an empty array `codeBlocks` to store code blocks temporarily.
    - Replace code blocks and inline code in the content with placeholders and store them in `codeBlocks`.
    - Initialize an empty array `latexExpressions` to store LaTeX expressions temporarily.
    - Replace block and inline LaTeX expressions with placeholders and store them in `latexExpressions`, ensuring inline math is not mistaken for currency.
    - Escape dollar signs that are likely currency indicators, now that inline math is protected.
    - Restore LaTeX expressions by replacing placeholders with the original expressions from `latexExpressions`.
    - Restore code blocks by replacing placeholders with the original code blocks from `codeBlocks`.
    - Apply additional escaping functions `escapeBrackets` and `escapeMhchem` to further process the content.
- **Output**: A processed string with LaTeX expressions properly formatted and certain characters escaped.


---
### escapeBrackets
The `escapeBrackets` function processes a string to escape LaTeX-style brackets while preserving code blocks and inline code.
- **Inputs**:
    - `text`: A string containing potential code blocks, inline code, and LaTeX-style expressions that need processing.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Define a regex pattern to match code blocks, inline code, and LaTeX-style expressions.
    - Use the `replace` method on the input `text` with the defined pattern to process each match.
    - If a match is a code block, return it unchanged.
    - If a match is a LaTeX-style square bracket expression, convert it to a double dollar sign format.
    - If a match is a LaTeX-style round bracket expression, convert it to a single dollar sign format.
    - Return the processed text.
- **Output**: A string with LaTeX-style brackets escaped, while preserving code blocks and inline code.


---
### escapeMhchem
The `escapeMhchem` function modifies a given text by escaping specific LaTeX chemistry commands to ensure proper rendering.
- **Inputs**:
    - `text`: A string containing LaTeX expressions that may include chemistry commands like '\ce{}' or '\pu{}'.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses the `replaceAll` method to find all occurrences of the string '$\ce{' and replaces them with '$\\ce{'.
    - Similarly, it replaces all occurrences of '$\pu{' with '$\\pu{'.
- **Output**: A string with the specified LaTeX chemistry commands properly escaped for rendering.
