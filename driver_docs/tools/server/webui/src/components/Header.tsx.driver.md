# Purpose
This code defines a React functional component named `Header`, which serves as a user interface element for a web application. The component is responsible for rendering a header section that includes a title, a button to toggle a sidebar, and controls for accessing settings and changing themes. The `Header` component utilizes several imported utilities and components, such as `StorageUtils` for managing theme persistence, `useAppContext` for accessing application-wide context, and icons from the `@heroicons/react` library for visual elements.

The `Header` component manages its state using the `useState` hook to track the currently selected theme, which is initially set by retrieving the theme from `StorageUtils`. It also uses the `useEffect` hook to update the document's body attributes whenever the selected theme changes, ensuring that the theme is applied consistently across the application. The component provides a dropdown menu for theme selection, allowing users to choose from predefined themes, which are dynamically rendered from the `THEMES` configuration.

Overall, the `Header` component is a cohesive unit that integrates theme management and user interface controls into a single, reusable component. It leverages React's state management and lifecycle features to provide a responsive and interactive user experience, while also maintaining a clean separation of concerns by utilizing utility functions and context for shared application logic.

# Functions

### Header
The `Header` function is a React component that renders a header with theme selection and settings options, managing theme state and applying it to the document body.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `selectedTheme` state with the current theme from `StorageUtils`.
    - Retrieve `setShowSettings` function from the application context using `useAppContext`.
    - Define `setTheme` function to update the theme in `StorageUtils` and state.
    - Use `useEffect` to apply the `selectedTheme` to the document body attributes for theme and color scheme.
    - Render a header with a sidebar toggle button, title, settings button, and theme selection dropdown.
    - The settings button triggers `setShowSettings` to true when clicked.
    - The theme dropdown allows selection of themes, updating the theme state and storage when a theme is selected.
- **Output**: The function returns a JSX element representing the header component with theme and settings controls.

### setTheme
The `setTheme` function updates the application's theme by storing the selected theme in local storage and updating the state to reflect the new theme.
- **Inputs**:
    - `theme`: A string representing the name of the theme to be set.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `StorageUtils.setTheme(theme)` to store the selected theme in local storage.
    - Update the state variable `selectedTheme` with the new theme value.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs side effects by updating local storage and state.
