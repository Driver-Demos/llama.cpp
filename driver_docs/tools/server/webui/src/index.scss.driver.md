# Purpose
This code is a stylesheet written in SCSS, a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS. It provides broad functionality for styling web pages, incorporating utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS and plugins such as DaisyUI to enhance the design system. The file includes custom styles for HTML elements, markdown content, buttons, chat interfaces, and syntax highlighting, indicating its role in defining the visual presentation of a web application. It also adapts styles based on the user's color scheme preference, supporting both light and dark modes. The use of SCSS features like `@use`, `@plugin`, and `@apply` suggests that this file is intended to be part of a larger build process, where it will be compiled into standard CSS for deployment.
