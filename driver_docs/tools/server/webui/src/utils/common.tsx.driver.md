# Purpose
This source code file defines a set of React components that provide specific UI functionalities, primarily related to buttons and links. The components are designed to be reusable and customizable, offering a consistent user interface experience across different parts of a web application. The file exports three main components: `XCloseButton`, `OpenInNewTab`, and `BtnWithTooltips`, each serving a distinct purpose.

The `XCloseButton` component is a React functional component that renders a button styled with specific classes and includes an SVG icon representing a close action (an "X" shape). It accepts standard HTML button attributes and additional class names, allowing for further customization. This component is useful for implementing a close or dismiss action in a user interface.

The `OpenInNewTab` component is a simple link component that renders an anchor (`<a>`) element. It is designed to open the provided `href` in a new browser tab, ensuring security by using `rel="noopener noreferrer"`. This component is useful for creating links that direct users to external resources without navigating away from the current page.

The `BtnWithTooltips` component is a more complex button component that includes tooltip functionality. It wraps a button within a `div` that acts as a tooltip container, displaying the tooltip content specified by the `tooltipsContent` prop. The component also handles click and mouse leave events, and it can be disabled if needed. This component is particularly useful for providing additional context or information to users when they interact with the button.
