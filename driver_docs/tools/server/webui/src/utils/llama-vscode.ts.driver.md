# Purpose
This code defines a React hook named `useVSCodeContext`, which provides a narrow functionality specifically designed for integration with a WebUI, such as llama.cpp, when used within an iframe in a VSCode extension. The hook listens for messages from a parent window to update a chat textarea and manage additional context, facilitating communication between the iframe and its parent. It also includes a keydown event listener to send a message when the "Escape" key is pressed, indicating a user action to the parent window. This file is intended to be a part of a larger application, likely imported and used within a React component to handle specific interactions and data flow between the iframe and its parent environment.

- **Type**: `interface`
- **Members**:
    - `text`: A string representing the text content to be set.
    - `context`: A string representing additional context information.
- **Description**: The `SetTextEvData` interface is a data structure used to encapsulate the text and context information for communication between a parent window and an iframe, specifically in the context of the llama.cpp WebUI from llama-vscode. It contains two string fields: `text`, which holds the main text content, and `context`, which provides supplementary context information. This interface is utilized in message events to update the textarea and context within the iframe.
