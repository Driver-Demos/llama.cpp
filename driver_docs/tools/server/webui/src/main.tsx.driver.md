# Purpose
This code is a JavaScript entry point file for a React application, typically named `index.js` or `index.tsx`, which serves as the main executable script to bootstrap the application. It provides narrow functionality focused on rendering the root component of the application, `App`, into the DOM element with the ID 'root'. The code imports necessary modules, including React's `StrictMode` for highlighting potential problems in an application, and styles from `index.scss` to apply global styles. By using `createRoot` from `react-dom/client`, it initializes the React application with the latest concurrent rendering capabilities, ensuring efficient updates and rendering.
