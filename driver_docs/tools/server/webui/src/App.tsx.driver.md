# Purpose
This code defines the main application component for a React-based web application, providing a structured layout and routing functionality. It is an executable file, likely the entry point of the application, as it sets up the primary components and routes using React Router's `HashRouter` and `Routes`. The `App` component wraps the application in a `ModalProvider` and `AppContextProvider`, indicating the use of context for state management and modal handling. The `AppLayout` component organizes the user interface with a `Sidebar`, `Header`, and dynamic content area managed by `Outlet`, which renders the matched child route component. Additionally, it includes a `SettingDialog` for user settings and a `Toaster` for notifications, suggesting a focus on user interaction and feedback. Overall, the file provides a broad functionality as it integrates various components and context providers to establish the application's core structure and behavior.

# Functions

---
### App
The `App` function sets up the main structure and routing for a React application using a hash-based router, context providers, and layout components.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Wraps the application in a `ModalProvider` to manage modal states.
    - Uses `HashRouter` to enable hash-based routing for the application.
    - Defines a flexbox layout with a `div` containing the main application structure.
    - Wraps the routing logic within an `AppContextProvider` to provide global state management.
    - Sets up `Routes` with a default layout `AppLayout` and defines routes for chat screens.
    - The `AppLayout` component uses `useAppContext` to manage settings visibility and renders `Sidebar`, `Header`, and `Outlet` for nested routes.
    - Includes a `SettingDialog` component that is conditionally displayed based on context state.
    - Renders a `Toaster` component for displaying toast notifications.
- **Output**: The function returns a JSX element that represents the main application structure with routing and context providers.


---
### AppLayout
The `AppLayout` function defines the layout structure of the application, including the sidebar, header, main content area, and settings dialog, while managing the visibility of the settings dialog through context.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve `showSettings` and `setShowSettings` from the application context using `useAppContext`.
    - Render a `Sidebar` component.
    - Render a `main` element with specific styling classes, containing a `Header` and an `Outlet` for nested routes.
    - Render a `SettingDialog` component, passing `showSettings` to control its visibility and `setShowSettings` to handle its closure.
    - Render a `Toaster` component for displaying toast notifications.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it returns a JSX fragment that represents the layout structure of the application.
