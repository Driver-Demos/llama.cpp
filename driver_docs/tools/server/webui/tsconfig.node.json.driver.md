# Purpose
The provided JSON configuration file is a TypeScript configuration file, typically named `tsconfig.json`, which is used to specify the compiler options for a TypeScript project. The `compilerOptions` section defines various settings for the TypeScript compiler, such as the target ECMAScript version (`ES2022`), the library to include (`ES2023`), and the module system (`ESNext`). It also includes settings for bundler mode, such as `moduleResolution` set to "bundler" and `noEmit` to prevent output file generation. Additionally, the configuration enforces strict linting rules, ensuring code quality by enabling options like `strict`, `noUnusedLocals`, and `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`. The `include` array specifies that the TypeScript compiler should only consider the `vite.config.ts` file for compilation.
