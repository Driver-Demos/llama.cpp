# Purpose
This HTML file serves as the basic structure for a web page titled "ðŸ¦™ llama.cpp - chat." It includes metadata for character encoding, viewport settings, and color scheme preferences. The body contains a root div for rendering content and a script tag that imports a TypeScript module from "/src/main.tsx" to handle the application's functionality.
