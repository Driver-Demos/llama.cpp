# Purpose
This file is a configuration file for Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, and it is written in JavaScript. The file specifies the paths to the HTML and JavaScript/TypeScript files where Tailwind CSS classes will be applied, ensuring that unused styles are purged in production builds. The `theme` section allows for customization of the default Tailwind theme, although it is currently set to extend without any modifications. The `plugins` array includes the `daisyui` plugin, which is a Tailwind CSS component library that provides pre-designed UI components. The `daisyui` configuration specifies a wide array of themes that can be used to quickly switch between different visual styles for the application.
