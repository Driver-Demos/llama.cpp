# Purpose
The provided content is a `package.json` file, which is a configuration file used in Node.js projects to manage project metadata, dependencies, and scripts. This file specifies the project's name as "webui" and indicates that it is a private module, meaning it is not intended to be published to the npm registry. The "scripts" section defines various command-line scripts for development tasks such as starting a development server with Vite, building the project, formatting code with ESLint and Prettier, and previewing the build. The "dependencies" and "devDependencies" sections list the libraries and tools required for the project to function and for development purposes, respectively, including React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. Additionally, the "prettier" section configures code formatting rules, such as using single quotes and setting the tab width to 2 spaces.
