# Purpose
The provided content is a comprehensive documentation for configuring and using a lightweight HTTP server built with C/C++ for interacting with the LLaMA.cpp project. This server is designed to facilitate the deployment and interaction with large language models (LLMs) through REST APIs and a web-based user interface. The file outlines various features of the server, such as LLM inference on both GPU and CPU, OpenAI API-compatible endpoints, multimodal support, and a range of configuration options for performance tuning and model management. It includes detailed instructions on how to build the server with or without SSL support, configure it using command-line arguments or environment variables, and utilize its endpoints for tasks like text completion, tokenization, and embedding generation. The documentation is crucial for developers looking to integrate LLaMA.cpp into their applications, providing them with the necessary tools and instructions to effectively deploy and manage the server in various environments, including Docker and Node.js.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a comprehensive documentation for the LLaMA.cpp HTTP Server, a fast and lightweight HTTP server implemented in C/C++. This server is designed to facilitate interaction with the llama.cpp library, providing a set of REST APIs for large language model (LLM) inference and a simple web front end. The server supports both GPU and CPU for inference of F16 and quantized models, and it is compatible with OpenAI API for chat completions and embeddings.

### Key Features:
- **Inference Capabilities**: Supports LLM inference on both GPU and CPU, handling F16 and quantized models.
- **API Compatibility**: Offers OpenAI API-compatible routes for chat completions and embeddings, along with a reranking endpoint.
- **Advanced Features**: Includes parallel decoding with multi-user support, continuous batching, multimodal support, monitoring endpoints, and schema-constrained JSON responses.
- **Web UI**: Provides an easy-to-use web interface built with React, TailwindCSS, and DaisyUI, allowing interaction with the model through a `/chat/completions` endpoint.
- **Development and Contribution**: The project is actively developed, with an open call for feedback and contributions.

### Configuration and Usage:
- **Common Parameters**: The server can be configured using a variety of command-line arguments, such as setting the number of threads, CPU affinity, process priority, and context size. It also supports environment variables for configuration.
- **Sampling Parameters**: Offers extensive options for controlling text generation, including temperature, top-k, top-p, and various penalties for repetition.
- **Example-Specific Parameters**: Includes options for context management, batching, and multimodal projector settings.

### API Endpoints:
- **Health Check**: A GET endpoint to check server health.
- **Completion**: A POST endpoint for generating text completions based on a given prompt.
- **Tokenization**: POST endpoints for tokenizing and detokenizing text.
- **Embedding and Reranking**: POST endpoints for generating embeddings and reranking documents.
- **OpenAI-Compatible Endpoints**: Supports OpenAI-like API endpoints for models, completions, chat completions, and embeddings.

### Build and Deployment:
- **Build Instructions**: Provides instructions for building the server using CMake, with optional SSL support.
- **Docker Support**: Includes examples for running the server in a Docker container, with options for CUDA support.

### Additional Features:
- **Metrics and Monitoring**: Supports Prometheus-compatible metrics and slots monitoring for debugging.
- **Advanced Testing**: Implements a server test framework for scenario-based testing.
- **Extensibility**: Offers options for extending or building alternative web front ends.

This documentation is essential for developers looking to deploy and interact with LLaMA.cpp models via a robust HTTP server, providing detailed configuration options and usage instructions to optimize performance and integration.
