# Purpose
The file is a Prometheus configuration file that defines global settings and scrape configurations for monitoring. It sets a global scrape interval of 10 seconds and assigns an external label "llamacpp" with the value "server". Additionally, it configures a scrape job named "llama.cpp server" to monitor a target running on "localhost" at port "8080".
