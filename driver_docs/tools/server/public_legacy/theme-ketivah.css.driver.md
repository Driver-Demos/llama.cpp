# Content Summary
The provided content is a CSS stylesheet for a theme named "ketivah," authored by Yazan Agha-Schrader. This stylesheet defines a comprehensive set of color variables using the CSS custom properties (variables) feature. These variables are organized into several categories, including primary colors, secondary colors, nuance colors, and ROYGP (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Purple) colors, each specified using HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) values or hexadecimal color codes.

### Key Components:

1. **Primary Colors**: These are light shades of gray, ranging from very light (99.2% lightness) to slightly darker (80% lightness). They are used for background colors and borders, providing a neutral base for the theme.

2. **Secondary Colors**: These are darker shades of gray, ranging from 20% to 36.1% lightness. They are primarily used for text colors, providing contrast against the lighter primary colors.

3. **Nuance Colors**: These colors have a greenish hue (around 165.2) and are used for focus elements like border focus and chat ID colors. They add subtle color variations to the theme.

4. **ROYGP Colors**: These include specific colors for red, orange, yellow, green, and purple, used for alert buttons and other elements that require distinct color coding.

5. **Button Styles**: The theme defines styles for primary, secondary, and tertiary buttons, including their default, hover, and active states. Primary buttons are designed to catch the eye with more vibrant colors, while secondary buttons are more subdued. Tertiary buttons are styled to appear disabled.

6. **Additional Elements**: The stylesheet also includes variables for UI elements like range thumbs, text areas, and loading indicators, ensuring a consistent color scheme across the user interface.

Overall, this stylesheet provides a structured and flexible approach to theming, allowing developers to easily apply and modify the color scheme across a web application by adjusting the defined variables.
