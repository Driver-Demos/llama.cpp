# Purpose
This code defines a JavaScript object named `systemPrompts`, which serves as a collection of configuration variables for different AI assistant personas. Each key within the object represents a unique persona or configuration, and the associated value is an object containing a `systemPrompt` string. These prompts provide specific instructions or guidelines for how each AI persona should interact with users, ranging from being a friendly chatbot to a specialized programming assistant. The file is likely intended to be imported and used in a broader application where these prompts guide the behavior of AI models during user interactions, indicating that it provides narrow functionality focused on configuring conversational AI systems.
