# Purpose
The provided content is a CSS file that defines a theme named "mangotango" for a web application. This file is responsible for configuring the visual appearance of the application by specifying a set of color variables using the CSS custom properties (variables) feature. The theme includes primary, secondary, and nuance colors, each defined using HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) values, which are then applied to various UI components such as backgrounds, borders, text, and buttons. The file organizes these colors into conceptual categories like primary, secondary, and nuance colors, and further specifies styles for different button states (e.g., hover, active) to ensure a consistent and visually appealing user interface. This file is crucial for maintaining a cohesive design system within the codebase, allowing for easy updates and customization of the application's look and feel.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a CSS stylesheet configuration for a theme named "mangotango." This theme defines a comprehensive set of color variables using the HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) color model, which are used to style various UI components. The theme is structured into several sections, each focusing on different aspects of the UI design, such as primary, secondary, and nuance colors, as well as specific UI elements like buttons and text.

### Key Components:

1. **Primary and Secondary Colors:**
   - The theme defines four primary colors and four secondary colors, each specified with HSL values. These colors are used to establish the base color palette for the theme. Each color is further broken down into its saturation and lightness components, allowing for dynamic adjustments.

2. **Nuance Colors:**
   - A set of nuance colors is defined, all sharing the same HSL values, which provide additional styling options for elements that require a distinct accent or focus.

3. **ROYGP Colors:**
   - This section includes a set of colors named after the rainbow sequence (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple), providing a vibrant palette for various UI elements.

4. **UI Element Colors:**
   - Background, border, text, and code colors are defined using the primary and secondary color variables. This ensures consistency across the UI and allows for easy theme adjustments.

5. **Button Styles:**
   - The theme specifies styles for primary, secondary, and tertiary buttons, including their default, hover, and active states. Each button type is designed with a specific purpose: primary buttons are meant to catch the eye, secondary buttons are more subdued, and tertiary buttons are used for disabled states. The hover and active states are dynamically calculated using the base color's saturation and lightness, providing visual feedback to user interactions.

6. **Focus and Interaction Colors:**
   - Special colors are defined for focus states and interactive elements like range sliders and text areas, ensuring that user interactions are visually distinct and accessible.

This theme configuration is essential for developers who need to maintain or extend the visual design of an application. By using CSS variables, the theme allows for easy customization and scalability, enabling developers to create a cohesive and visually appealing user interface.
