# Purpose
The file content provided is a CSS stylesheet, specifically a theme configuration file, which defines a set of custom properties (CSS variables) for styling a user interface. This file provides narrow functionality focused on theming, allowing for consistent application of colors across various UI components such as backgrounds, borders, text, and buttons. The file is organized into conceptual categories, including primary, secondary, and nuance colors, as well as specific styles for different button states (e.g., hover, active). The relevance of this file to a codebase lies in its role in maintaining a cohesive visual design, enabling easy updates to the theme by simply modifying the variable values, which can be referenced throughout the application's stylesheets. This approach enhances maintainability and scalability of the UI design.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a CSS theme configuration file named `.theme-beeninorder`, authored by Yazan Agha-Schrader. This file defines a comprehensive set of color variables using the HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) color model, which are intended to style a user interface with a consistent theme. The theme is inspired by a Batman wallpaper, as noted in the comments.

The file organizes colors into several categories: primary, secondary, nuance, and ROYGP (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Purple) colors. Each category is defined with specific HSL values, and some colors are further broken down into their individual hue, saturation, and lightness components for more granular control.

- **Primary Colors**: These are darker shades, ranging from 19% to 40% lightness, and are used for background and border colors.
- **Secondary Colors**: These are lighter shades, ranging from 60% to 80% lightness, and are used for text and code background colors.
- **Nuance Colors**: These are bright, vibrant colors with high saturation, used for focus and UI elements like range thumbs and chat IDs.
- **ROYGP Colors**: These are specific colors for alert buttons, providing a range of hues for different states.

The file also defines styles for various button states (primary, secondary, and tertiary) with specific hover and active states. Primary buttons are designed to be eye-catching, using bright nuance colors, while secondary buttons are more subdued, using primary colors. Tertiary buttons, which are likely disabled, use a combination of primary colors.

Each button state (default, hover, active) is meticulously defined with specific color adjustments, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user interface. The use of CSS variables allows for easy theme adjustments and consistency across the application. This file is crucial for developers aiming to maintain a cohesive visual identity in their software application.
