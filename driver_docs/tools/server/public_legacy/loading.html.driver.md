# Purpose
This HTML file is a simple webpage that displays a loading message to the user, indicating that a model is currently loading and the user interface will appear shortly. The `<meta>` tag in the `<head>` section automatically refreshes the page every 5 seconds, likely to update the content once the model has finished loading.
