# Content Summary
The provided content is a CSS stylesheet configuration for a theme named "Polarnight," inspired by the Nord Theme. This stylesheet defines a comprehensive set of color variables using the HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) color model, which are organized into several categories: primary colors, secondary colors, nuance colors, and ROYGP (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Purple) colors. These variables are intended to be used throughout a web application to maintain a consistent color scheme.

The primary colors are defined with four variations, each with specific hue, saturation, and lightness values. These colors are likely used for the main elements of the theme, such as backgrounds and borders. Secondary colors are also defined with four variations, providing lighter shades that are typically used for text and subtler UI elements.

Nuance colors offer additional shades that can be used for specific UI components, such as focus states and shadows. The ROYGP colors provide a set of vibrant colors for specific elements that require distinct color coding, such as alerts or notifications.

The stylesheet also includes detailed configurations for various button states, including primary, secondary, and tertiary buttons. Each button type has specific color settings for its default, hover, and active states, ensuring visual feedback and interaction cues for users. The primary buttons are designed to be eye-catching, while secondary and tertiary buttons are more subdued, with tertiary buttons often representing disabled states.

Overall, this stylesheet provides a structured and flexible approach to theming, allowing developers to apply a cohesive and visually appealing color scheme across a web application. The use of CSS variables facilitates easy customization and maintenance of the theme.
