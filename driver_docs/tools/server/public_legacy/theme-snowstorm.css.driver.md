# Purpose
The provided content is a CSS file that defines a color theme for a user interface, inspired by the Nord Theme. This file is used to configure the visual appearance of a software application by specifying various color variables for primary, secondary, and nuance colors, as well as specific UI components like buttons, text, and backgrounds. The file offers a broad functionality by covering a wide range of UI elements, ensuring a consistent and cohesive look and feel across the application. The color variables are defined using HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) values, allowing for easy adjustments and maintenance. This file is crucial for the codebase as it centralizes the color scheme, making it easier to manage and update the application's design without altering individual component styles.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a CSS theme configuration file named `.theme-snowstorm`, which defines a comprehensive color scheme for a user interface, inspired by the Nord Theme. This file is structured to specify various color variables using the HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) color model, which allows for easy adjustments and consistency across the UI components.

The theme is organized into several sections, each defining a set of colors for different UI elements:

1. **Primary Colors**: These are the main colors used throughout the theme, defined with specific HSL values. Each primary color is broken down into its hue, saturation, and lightness components for precise control.

2. **Secondary Colors**: These colors complement the primary colors and are used for elements that require a different emphasis or contrast. Like the primary colors, they are also detailed with their HSL components.

3. **Nuance Colors**: These colors provide additional variations and are used for subtle UI elements, offering a range of hues and saturations to enhance the theme's depth.

4. **ROYGP Colors**: This section includes specific colors for red, orange, yellow, green, and purple, which can be used for alerts, highlights, or other specific UI needs.

5. **UI Element Colors**: This section maps the defined colors to specific UI elements such as background, border, text, and code elements. It uses the previously defined primary, secondary, and nuance colors to ensure consistency.

6. **Button Styles**: The theme defines styles for different button states (primary, secondary, tertiary) and their interactions (hover, active). Each button type is designed to either catch the user's eye or remain subtle, depending on its purpose. The button styles are dynamically calculated using the HSL values of the nuance colors, allowing for a cohesive look and feel.

Overall, this theme configuration file provides a detailed and flexible color scheme that can be easily adjusted and applied across a software application to maintain a consistent and visually appealing user interface.
