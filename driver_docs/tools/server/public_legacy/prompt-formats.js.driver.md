# Purpose
The provided code is a JavaScript module that exports a collection of prompt formats for various conversational AI models. Each format is defined as an object within the `promptFormats` object, and these objects specify templates and configurations for structuring prompts and handling conversational history. The module is designed to support different AI models by providing tailored prompt structures that align with the specific requirements or conventions of each model. This includes defining how user and assistant messages are formatted, how conversation history is integrated, and any special tokens or markers that are used to delineate different parts of the conversation.

The code is organized into a series of named objects, each corresponding to a different AI model or prompt format, such as "alpaca," "chatml," "llama2," and others. Each object contains several key properties: `template`, `historyTemplate`, `char`, `user`, and `stops`. The `template` property defines the overall structure of the prompt, incorporating placeholders for dynamic content like the prompt itself, conversation history, and the character (assistant) response. The `historyTemplate` property specifies how past interactions are formatted and included in the prompt. The `char` and `user` properties define the labels or tokens used to represent the assistant and user, respectively, while the `stops` property may include special tokens that indicate the end of a conversation or segment.

This module serves as a configuration library for developers working with multiple AI models, allowing them to easily switch between different prompt formats by referencing the appropriate object within `promptFormats`. It abstracts the complexity of managing different prompt structures and ensures consistency in how prompts are constructed and processed across various models. The inclusion of references to external documentation for some formats suggests that these configurations are aligned with established standards or guidelines for interacting with specific AI models.
# Global Variables

---
### promptFormats
- **Type**: `object`
- **Description**: The `promptFormats` variable is a global object that defines various templates for different conversational models. Each key in the object represents a specific model, such as 'alpaca', 'chatml', 'commandr', etc., and contains a set of properties that define the structure of prompts, history templates, character roles, and message formatting for that model. This allows for consistent and structured communication with different AI models by providing a standardized way to format input and output messages.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and organize different prompt and message formatting templates for various conversational AI models.


# Data Structures

---
### promptFormats
- **Type**: `Object`
- **Members**:
    - `alpaca`: Defines the template and message structure for the 'alpaca' prompt format.
    - `chatml`: Specifies the template and message structure for the 'chatml' prompt format.
    - `commandr`: Outlines the template and message structure for the 'commandr' prompt format.
    - `llama2`: Describes the template and message structure for the 'llama2' prompt format.
    - `llama3`: Details the template and message structure for the 'llama3' prompt format.
    - `openchat`: Provides the template and message structure for the 'openchat' prompt format.
    - `phi3`: Defines the template and message structure for the 'phi3' prompt format.
    - `vicuna`: Specifies the template and message structure for the 'vicuna' prompt format.
    - `deepseekCoder`: Outlines the template and message structure for the 'deepseekCoder' prompt format.
    - `med42`: Describes the template and message structure for the 'med42' prompt format.
    - `neuralchat`: Details the template and message structure for the 'neuralchat' prompt format.
    - `nousHermes`: Provides the template and message structure for the 'nousHermes' prompt format.
    - `openchatMath`: Defines the template and message structure for the 'openchatMath' prompt format.
    - `orion`: Specifies the template and message structure for the 'orion' prompt format.
    - `sauerkraut`: Outlines the template and message structure for the 'sauerkraut' prompt format.
    - `starlingCode`: Describes the template and message structure for the 'starlingCode' prompt format.
    - `yi34b`: Details the template and message structure for the 'yi34b' prompt format.
    - `zephyr`: Provides the template and message structure for the 'zephyr' prompt format.
- **Description**: The 'promptFormats' data structure is an object that defines various prompt formats used in different conversational AI models. Each key in the object represents a specific format, such as 'alpaca', 'chatml', or 'llama2', and contains a nested object with fields like 'template', 'historyTemplate', 'char', 'user', and 'stops'. These fields specify the structure and components of the prompts, including how the system, user, and assistant messages are formatted and how conversation history is integrated. This structure allows for flexible and consistent prompt generation across different AI models.
