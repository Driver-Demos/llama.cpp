# Purpose
The provided code is a JavaScript module designed to facilitate text generation using a server-based API, likely related to a language model such as llama.cpp. The module exports several functions that allow users to interact with the API in different ways, including streaming text generation, event-driven updates, and promise-based completion. The primary function, `llama`, is an asynchronous generator that sends a prompt and parameters to the API and yields chunks of generated text as they are received. It handles server communication, including setting up HTTP requests, managing response streams, and processing server-sent events (SSE).

The module defines default parameters for text generation, such as `n_predict` and `temperature`, which can be overridden by user-specified parameters. It also includes utility functions like `llamaEventTarget`, which returns an `EventTarget` for subscribing to text generation events, and `llamaPromise`, which returns a promise that resolves to the complete generated text. These functions provide flexibility in how the text generation results are consumed, whether through event listeners or promise resolution.

Additionally, the module includes a deprecated function, `llamaComplete`, and a utility function, `llamaModelInfo`, which retrieves model information from the server. This information can include settings like the context window size, which is useful for understanding the model's capabilities. Overall, the module provides a comprehensive interface for interacting with a text generation API, supporting both real-time and batch processing use cases.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `AbortController`
- `fetch`
- `TextDecoder`
- `EventTarget`
- `CustomEvent`


# Global Variables

---
### paramDefaults
- **Type**: `object`
- **Description**: The `paramDefaults` variable is a global constant object that holds default configuration parameters for a text generation function. It includes settings such as `stream` (a boolean indicating if streaming is enabled), `n_predict` (an integer specifying the number of tokens to predict), `temperature` (a float controlling randomness in generation), and `stop` (an array of strings indicating stop tokens).
- **Use**: This variable is used to provide default values for text generation requests, which can be overridden by user-specified parameters.


---
### generation\_settings
- **Type**: ``null` or `object``
- **Description**: `generation_settings` is a global variable initially set to `null` and is intended to store the generation settings received from the server during the execution of the `llama` function. It is updated when the server response includes generation settings, allowing the application to access and utilize these settings for subsequent operations.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and provide access to the generation settings received from the server, which can be utilized by other functions or components in the application.


# Functions

---
### llama
The `llama` function is an asynchronous generator that streams text completions from a server based on a given prompt and parameters.
- **Inputs**:
    - `prompt`: A string representing the initial text or query to be completed by the server.
    - `params`: An optional object containing parameters to customize the text generation, such as `n_predict`, `temperature`, and `stop` tokens.
    - `config`: An optional object containing configuration settings like `api_url` and `controller` for the request.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the `controller` from `config` or create a new `AbortController` if not provided.
    - Merge `paramDefaults`, `params`, and `prompt` into `completionParams`.
    - Send a POST request to the server using the `fetch` API with `completionParams` as the body.
    - Read the response stream using a `ReadableStreamDefaultReader` and a `TextDecoder`.
    - Iterate over the response stream, handling partial lines and decoding JSON data from the server.
    - Yield each parsed event from the server, checking for stop conditions or errors.
    - Handle errors by logging them and rethrowing if necessary.
    - Abort the controller when the operation is complete or an error occurs.
- **Output**: The function yields parsed server events as they are received, each containing data about the text completion, and returns the final concatenated content when the stream ends.


---
### llamaEventTarget
The `llamaEventTarget` function initiates a text generation process using the `llama` function and returns an `EventTarget` to which events can be subscribed.
- **Inputs**:
    - `prompt`: A string representing the initial text or query to be completed by the text generation process.
    - `params`: An optional object containing parameters to customize the text generation, such as `n_predict`, `temperature`, and `api_key`.
    - `config`: An optional object containing configuration settings, such as `controller` and `api_url`, for the text generation process.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Create a new `EventTarget` instance to handle events.
    - Invoke the `llama` function asynchronously with the provided `prompt`, `params`, and `config`.
    - Iterate over the chunks of data yielded by the `llama` function using a for-await loop.
    - For each chunk, append the content to a cumulative string and dispatch a 'message' event with the chunk's data as the detail.
    - Dispatch additional events for 'generation_settings' and 'timings' if they are present in the chunk's data.
    - Once all chunks are processed, dispatch a 'done' event with the complete content as the detail.
- **Output**: An `EventTarget` object that allows subscription to events such as 'message', 'generation_settings', 'timings', and 'done'.


---
### llamaPromise
The `llamaPromise` function asynchronously generates text completions for a given prompt and returns the completed text as a promise.
- **Inputs**:
    - `prompt`: A string representing the initial text or query to be completed by the text generation model.
    - `params`: An optional object containing parameters to customize the text generation, such as `n_predict`, `temperature`, and `api_key`.
    - `config`: An optional object containing configuration settings, such as `api_url` and `endpoint`, for the API request.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize an empty string `content` to accumulate the generated text.
    - Use a try-catch block to handle asynchronous operations and potential errors.
    - Iterate over the chunks of data generated by the `llama` generator function using a for-await-of loop.
    - For each chunk, append the `chunk.data.content` to the `content` string.
    - If the iteration completes without errors, resolve the promise with the accumulated `content`.
    - If an error occurs during iteration, reject the promise with the error.
- **Output**: A promise that resolves to a string containing the completed text generated by the model.


---
### llamaComplete
The `llamaComplete` function is a deprecated asynchronous generator that processes text completion requests using the `llama` function and invokes a callback for each chunk of data received.
- **Inputs**:
    - `params`: An object containing parameters for the text completion request, including the prompt and other optional settings.
    - `controller`: An AbortController instance used to manage the request's lifecycle and allow for cancellation.
    - `callback`: A function to be called with each chunk of data received from the `llama` function.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function iterates over the asynchronous generator returned by the `llama` function, passing the `params.prompt`, `params`, and a configuration object containing the `controller`.
    - For each chunk of data yielded by the `llama` generator, the provided `callback` function is invoked with the chunk as its argument.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it operates by invoking the callback with each data chunk.


---
### llamaModelInfo
The `llamaModelInfo` function retrieves and caches model generation settings from a server endpoint.
- **Inputs**:
    - `config`: An optional configuration object that may contain an `api_url` property to specify the server URL.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `generation_settings` is already defined; if so, return it immediately.
    - If `generation_settings` is not defined, construct the `api_url` by removing trailing slashes from `config.api_url` or default to an empty string.
    - Fetch the model properties from the server endpoint `/props` using the constructed `api_url`.
    - Parse the JSON response to extract `default_generation_settings`.
    - Assign the extracted `default_generation_settings` to `generation_settings`.
    - Return the `generation_settings`.
- **Output**: The function returns the `generation_settings`, which are the default model generation settings retrieved from the server.
