# Purpose
The provided content is a markdown file that serves as documentation for benchmarking the batched decoding performance of a software tool called `llama.cpp`. This file is designed to guide users on how to execute performance tests using the `llama-batched-bench` command-line tool, which is part of the `llama.cpp` project. The document outlines two modes of operation—'prompt not shared' and 'prompt is shared'—and provides specific command examples for running benchmarks with different configurations. It also includes sample results in tabular form, detailing various performance metrics such as prompt processing time, text generation speed, and total speed. Additionally, the file explains how to output results in JSONL format, which is useful for further data analysis or integration with other systems. This documentation is crucial for developers and researchers who need to evaluate and optimize the performance of the `llama.cpp` model in different scenarios.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a documentation excerpt for a benchmarking tool used to evaluate the batched decoding performance of the `llama.cpp` software. This tool is designed to measure the efficiency of processing and generating text in batches, which is crucial for optimizing performance in machine learning models like LLaMA.

### Key Functional Details:

1. **Modes of Operation**: The tool supports two primary modes:
   - **Prompt Not Shared**: Each batch has its own unique prompt, with the required key-value (KV) cache size calculated as `N_KV = B*(PP + TG)`.
   - **Prompt Is Shared**: All batches use a common prompt, with the KV cache size calculated as `N_KV = PP + B*TG`.

2. **Command-Line Usage**: The tool is executed via command-line with various parameters:
   - `-m`: Specifies the model file.
   - `-c`: Sets the maximum KV cache size.
   - `-b`: Defines the batch size.
   - `-ub`: Sets the unbatched size.
   - `-npp`, `-ntg`, `-npl`: Define the number of prompt tokens, generated tokens, and prompt layers, respectively.
   - `-pps`: Indicates if the prompt is shared.

3. **Sample Commands**: Examples are provided for different configurations, such as using the LLaMA 7B model with different precision settings (F16, Q8_0) and batch configurations.

4. **Performance Metrics**: The tool outputs several performance metrics:
   - `PP`: Prompt tokens per batch.
   - `TG`: Generated tokens per batch.
   - `B`: Number of batches.
   - `N_KV`: Required KV cache size.
   - `T_PP`: Time to process the prompt.
   - `S_PP`: Speed of prompt processing.
   - `T_TG`: Time to generate all batches.
   - `S_TG`: Speed of text generation.
   - `T`: Total time taken.
   - `S`: Total speed (all tokens processed per total time).

5. **Output Formats**: Results can be output in Markdown or JSONL format. The JSONL format provides a structured output that includes detailed metrics for each batch configuration, such as maximum KV size, batch size, unbatched size, and processing speeds.

This documentation is essential for developers and researchers who need to benchmark and optimize the performance of their models using the `llama.cpp` framework, providing them with the necessary commands and metrics to evaluate different configurations effectively.
