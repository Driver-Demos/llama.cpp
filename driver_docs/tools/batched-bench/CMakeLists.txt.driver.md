# Purpose
This CMake configuration file defines the build process for an executable named "llama-batched-bench" from the source file "batched-bench.cpp". It specifies the installation of the executable, links it with the "common", "llama", and thread libraries, and enforces the use of C++17 standard features during compilation.
