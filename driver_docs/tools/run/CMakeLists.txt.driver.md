# Purpose
The provided content is a CMake configuration file, which is used to define the build process for a C++ project. This file specifies the creation of an executable named "llama-run" from the source files `run.cpp` and `linenoise.cpp`. It includes a conditional block to integrate the CURL library if the `LLAMA_CURL` option is enabled, setting up necessary compile definitions and library paths. The executable is linked with additional libraries, including `common`, `llama`, and any thread libraries required by CMake, as well as any extra libraries determined by the CURL configuration. The file also ensures that the executable is installed as a runtime target and specifies that the C++17 standard should be used for compilation.
