# Purpose
This CMake configuration file defines the build process for an executable named "llama-export-lora" from the source file "export-lora.cpp". It specifies that the executable should be installed as a runtime target and links it with the libraries "common", "llama", and the CMake thread libraries. Additionally, it enforces the use of the C++17 standard for compiling this target.
