# Purpose
The provided content is a markdown file that serves as a comprehensive guide for demonstrating the Text To Speech (TTS) feature using the llama.cpp software. This file is primarily focused on configuring and running a TTS example by utilizing specific models from OuteAI and Novateur, which are hosted on Hugging Face. It provides detailed instructions on downloading, converting, and quantizing the necessary models to the required formats, specifically .gguf, for use with the llama.cpp application. The document also includes commands for running the TTS example both locally and via a server setup, highlighting the steps to generate and play audio from text input. This file is crucial for users who wish to implement and test the TTS capabilities within the llama.cpp codebase, ensuring they have the correct setup and understanding of the process.
# Content Summary
The provided document is a comprehensive guide for setting up and running a Text To Speech (TTS) example using the `llama.cpp` framework. It details the process of utilizing a specific TTS model from OuteAI, which is designed to convert text input into speech output. The document is structured into several sections, each focusing on different aspects of the setup and execution process.

### Quickstart
The quickstart section provides a command to run the TTS example, assuming the `llama.cpp` has been built with the `-DLLAMA_CURL=ON` option. This command automatically downloads the required models and generates an audio file (`output.wav`) from the text input "Hello world", which can be played using a media player like `aplay`.

### Model Conversion
This section explains how to download and convert the necessary models for the TTS system. It involves cloning the OuteAI model repository and converting the model to the `.gguf` format using a Python script. The document also describes an optional quantization step to reduce the model size. Additionally, it covers the conversion of a voice decoder model from a PyTorch checkpoint to the Hugging Face format, and subsequently to the `.gguf` format.

### Running the Example
Once the models are prepared, the document provides instructions to run the TTS example using the converted models. The command generates an audio file from the text input, which can be played back to verify the TTS functionality.

### Running with `llama-server`
The document also outlines how to run the TTS example using `llama-server`, which involves setting up two server instances to serve the LLM model and the voice decoder model separately. It includes steps to create a Python virtual environment, install necessary dependencies, and execute a Python script (`tts-outetts.py`) to generate and play the audio.

Overall, the document serves as a detailed guide for developers to set up and execute a TTS example using the `llama.cpp` framework, covering model preparation, conversion, and execution both locally and via server instances.
