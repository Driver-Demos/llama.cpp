# Purpose
This Python script is designed to perform text-to-speech (TTS) conversion by generating audio from text input. It achieves this by interacting with two external services: a language model server and a decoder server. The script processes input text, tokenizes it, and sends it to the language model server to generate a sequence of tokens. These tokens are then sent to the decoder server to obtain embeddings, which are used to create a spectrogram. The spectrogram is subsequently converted into audio data using a series of signal processing functions, including inverse real FFT and windowing operations. The final audio is saved as a WAV file.

The script includes several key components: functions for signal processing (e.g., [`fill_hann_window`](#cpp/tools/tts/tts-outettsfill_hann_window), [`irfft`](#cpp/tools/tts/tts-outettsirfft), [`fold`](#cpp/tools/tts/tts-outettsfold)), a function to convert embeddings to audio ([`embd_to_audio`](#cpp/tools/tts/tts-outettsembd_to_audio)), and a function to save the audio data as a WAV file ([`save_wav`](#cpp/tools/tts/tts-outettssave_wav)). It also includes a text processing function ([`process_text`](#cpp/tools/tts/tts-outettsprocess_text)) to clean and tokenize the input text. The script is intended to be run as a standalone program, as indicated by its use of command-line arguments to specify server URLs and input text. The script's primary purpose is to facilitate the conversion of text into audio by leveraging external machine learning models and performing necessary audio processing tasks.
