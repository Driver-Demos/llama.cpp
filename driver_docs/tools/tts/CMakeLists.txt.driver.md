# Purpose
This CMake configuration file defines the build instructions for a C++ executable named "llama-tts". It specifies the source file "tts.cpp" for the executable, sets the installation rules for the runtime, links necessary libraries including "llama", "common", and threading libraries, and enforces the use of C++17 standard features during compilation.
