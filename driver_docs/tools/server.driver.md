- **[public_simplechat](server/public.driver.md_simplechat)**: The `public_simplechat` folder in the `llama.cpp` codebase contains files that collectively provide a web-based chat interface for interacting with AI language models, including HTML structure, CSS styling, JavaScript functionality for chat management, utility functions for text processing, and a comprehensive setup guide.
- **[tests](server/tests.driver.md)**: The `tests` folder in the `llama.cpp` codebase contains a comprehensive suite of unit tests and supporting files for testing server functionalities, including configuration files, scripts, and utilities for managing and executing tests using `pytest`.
- **[themes](server/themes.driver.md)**: The `themes` folder in the `llama.cpp` codebase contains subfolders with HTML files and documentation for different chatbot interface themes, along with a main README file that provides instructions for using these themes in the LLaMA.cpp server.
- **[webui](server/webui.driver.md)**: The `webui` folder in the `llama.cpp` codebase contains the structure and configuration for a React-based web user interface, including source code, styling, and build settings, with folders for public assets and source code, and files for configuration, dependency management, and build processes.

## Files
- **[chat-llama2.sh](server/chat-llama2.sh.driver.md)**: The `chat-llama2.sh` file is a Bash script that facilitates a chat interaction between a user and an AI assistant by formatting prompts, tokenizing input, and handling API requests to generate responses.
- **[chat.mjs](server/chat.mjs.driver.md)**: The `chat.mjs` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase implements a chat server that interacts with an AI assistant, handling user input, formatting prompts, and managing API requests for tokenization and completion.
- **[chat.sh](server/chat.sh.driver.md)**: The `chat.sh` file is a Bash script that facilitates a chat interaction between a human and an AI assistant by sending prompts to a local server for processing and displaying the assistant's responses.
- **[CMakeLists.txt](server/CMakeLists.txt.driver.md)**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `llama.cpp/tools/server` directory configures the build process for the `llama-server` target, including options for SSL support, asset management, and platform-specific settings.
- **[README.md](server/README.md.driver.md)**: The `README.md` file in the `llama.cpp/tools/server` directory provides comprehensive documentation for the LLaMA.cpp HTTP Server, detailing its features, usage instructions, API endpoints, and build processes, including support for multimodal models, OpenAI-compatible APIs, and a web-based user interface.
- **[server.cpp](server/server.cpp.driver.md)**: The `server.cpp` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase implements a server for handling various tasks such as text completion, embedding, and reranking, using a model loaded from the `llama` library, and provides endpoints for these functionalities, including support for OpenAI-compatible requests.
- **[utils.hpp](server/utils.hpp.driver.md)**: The `utils.hpp` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase provides a collection of utility functions and definitions for handling JSON parsing, tokenization, logging, and server operations, including support for OpenAI-compatible parameters and base64 encoding/decoding.
