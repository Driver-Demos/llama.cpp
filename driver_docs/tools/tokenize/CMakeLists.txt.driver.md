# Purpose
This CMake configuration file defines the build process for an executable named `llama-tokenize`. It specifies the source file `tokenize.cpp` for the executable, installs the runtime, links it with the `common`, `llama`, and thread libraries, and enforces the use of C++17 standard features during compilation.
