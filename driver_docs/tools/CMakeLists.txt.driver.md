# Purpose
The provided content is a CMake configuration file used to manage the build process of a software project. It specifies dependencies, such as requiring the Threads package, and sets up compile flags through a custom function `llama_add_compile_flags()`. The file organizes the inclusion of various subdirectories, each likely containing source code for different components or tools of the project, such as `batched-bench`, `llama-bench`, and `tokenize`. Conditional logic is used to include certain directories based on the presence of specific build options or environments, such as `EMSCRIPTEN`, `LLAMA_BUILD_SERVER`, and `GGML_RPC`. This modular approach allows for flexible and efficient management of the build process, enabling or disabling components based on the configuration and target environment.
