# Purpose
This CMake configuration file defines the build instructions for an executable named "llama-quantize" from the source file "quantize.cpp". It specifies the installation of the executable, links it with the libraries "common" and "llama", includes directories from "../../common", and enforces the use of C++17 standard features.
