# Purpose
This CMake configuration file defines the build process for an executable named `llama-gguf-split`. It specifies the source file `gguf-split.cpp` for the executable, sets the installation target for the runtime, links the executable with the `common`, `llama`, and thread libraries, and enforces the use of C++17 standard features during compilation.
