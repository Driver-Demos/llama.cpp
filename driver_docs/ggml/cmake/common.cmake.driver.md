# Purpose
The provided code is a CMake script that defines two functions, `ggml_get_flags` and `ggml_get_system_arch`, which are used to configure compiler flags and determine the system architecture, respectively. The `ggml_get_flags` function sets specific compiler flags based on the compiler ID (`CCID`) and version (`CCVER`), supporting both Clang and GNU compilers, and adjusts flags for specific versions to ensure compatibility and enable certain warnings. The `ggml_get_system_arch` function identifies the system architecture by checking various CMake variables and processor identifiers, setting the architecture type (such as ARM, x86, PowerPC, loongarch64, riscv64, or s390x) to a parent scope variable. This script is essential for ensuring that the software is compiled with the appropriate settings and optimizations for the target system architecture and compiler.
