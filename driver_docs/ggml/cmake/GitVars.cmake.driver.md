# Purpose
The provided code is a CMake script that integrates Git functionality to extract specific metadata about the current state of the code repository. It uses the `find_package(Git)` command to ensure that Git is available for use. The script then executes a series of Git commands to retrieve and store information about the latest commit. Specifically, it captures the commit's SHA1 hash, the date of the commit, and the commit's subject line. These details are stored in the variables `GIT_SHA1`, `GIT_DATE`, and `GIT_COMMIT_SUBJECT`, respectively. This metadata can be used for version tracking, logging, or display purposes within the build process.
