# Purpose
This C source code file provides a specialized interface for managing memory allocation in the context of tensor operations, specifically within a backend framework. The file defines structures and functions for two main components: tensor allocators (`ggml_tallocr`) and graph allocators (`ggml_gallocr`). These components are designed to facilitate efficient memory management for tensor computations, which are critical in high-performance computing tasks such as machine learning and scientific simulations. The code includes functions to create new allocators, allocate memory for tensors and computation graphs, and manage buffer sizes, ensuring that memory is used optimally and reallocations are minimized.

The file is structured to be part of a larger library, as indicated by the use of `#pragma once` for header inclusion protection and the `GGML_API` macro, which suggests that these functions are part of a public API. The code is designed to be compatible with both C and C++ environments, as shown by the `extern "C"` block. The functions provided allow for the creation and management of backend buffers and contexts, which are essential for executing tensor operations efficiently. The documentation within the code provides guidance on how to use these functions, including example usage patterns and explanations of specific flags for tensor allocation. Overall, this file is a crucial component for developers working with the GGML library, providing the necessary tools for effective memory management in tensor-based computations.

### ggml\_tallocr
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `buffer`: A pointer to a ggml_backend_buffer_t, representing the backend buffer used for tensor allocation.
    - `base`: A void pointer indicating the base address for the memory allocation.
    - `alignment`: A size_t value specifying the alignment requirement for the memory allocation.
    - `offset`: A size_t value representing the current offset within the allocated buffer.
- **Description**: The `ggml_tallocr` structure is a tensor allocator used in the GGML library to manage memory allocation for tensors. It holds a reference to a backend buffer, a base address for the allocation, and alignment and offset information to ensure efficient memory usage and access. This structure is essential for handling tensor allocations in a way that optimizes performance and memory usage in computational graphs.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

### ggml\_tallocr\_new<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_tallocr_new}} -->
Creates a new tensor allocator with specified buffer settings.
- **Description**: This function initializes a new tensor allocator using the provided backend buffer, setting up the necessary alignment and base address for memory allocation. It is essential to ensure that the buffer passed to this function is valid and properly configured, as the function assumes the alignment is a power of two and will assert if this condition is not met. This function is typically used when setting up memory management for tensor operations, ensuring that allocations are aligned according to the buffer's specifications.
- **Inputs**:
    - `buffer`: A valid ggml_backend_buffer_t object representing the backend buffer to be used for tensor allocations. The buffer must be properly initialized and configured, with an alignment that is a power of two. The caller retains ownership of the buffer.
- **Output**: Returns a ggml_tallocr structure initialized with the base address, alignment, and offset derived from the provided buffer.
- **See also**: [`ggml_tallocr_new`](../src/ggml-alloc.c.driver.md#ggml_tallocr_new)  (Implementation)


---
### ggml\_tallocr\_alloc<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_tallocr_alloc}} -->
Allocates memory for a tensor using a tensor allocator.
- **Description**: This function is used to allocate memory for a given tensor within a specified tensor allocator. It should be called when a tensor needs to be allocated in a pre-defined buffer managed by the tensor allocator. The function ensures that the allocated memory is properly aligned according to the allocator's alignment requirements. It is important to ensure that there is enough space in the buffer before calling this function, as it will abort the operation if the buffer does not have sufficient space to accommodate the tensor.
- **Inputs**:
    - `talloc`: A pointer to a ggml_tallocr structure representing the tensor allocator. This must not be null and should be properly initialized with a buffer before calling this function.
    - `tensor`: A pointer to a ggml_tensor structure representing the tensor to be allocated. This must not be null and should be properly initialized.
- **Output**: Returns an enum ggml_status indicating the success or failure of the allocation operation.
- **See also**: [`ggml_tallocr_alloc`](../src/ggml-alloc.c.driver.md#ggml_tallocr_alloc)  (Implementation)


---
### ggml\_gallocr\_free<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_gallocr_free}} -->
Frees resources associated with a graph allocator.
- **Description**: Use this function to release all resources and memory associated with a graph allocator when it is no longer needed. This function should be called to prevent memory leaks after the graph allocator has been used. It is safe to call this function with a null pointer, in which case it will have no effect. Ensure that no other operations are performed on the graph allocator after it has been freed.
- **Inputs**:
    - `galloc`: A graph allocator handle to be freed. It must be a valid, non-null pointer to a graph allocator previously created with ggml_gallocr_new or ggml_gallocr_new_n, or it can be null, in which case the function does nothing.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`ggml_gallocr_free`](../src/ggml-alloc.c.driver.md#ggml_gallocr_free)  (Implementation)


---
### ggml\_gallocr\_reserve<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_gallocr_reserve}} -->
Pre-allocates buffers for a graph to avoid reallocations.
- **Description**: Use this function to pre-allocate buffers for a computational graph, which helps in avoiding buffer reallocations during graph execution. It is particularly useful when dealing with a worst-case graph scenario, ensuring that the necessary buffers are reserved in advance. This function does not modify the graph itself and is not strictly required if only a single buffer is used, as automatic reallocation will occur if needed. However, it is beneficial for performance optimization by preventing runtime reallocations. The function returns false if the buffer allocation fails, indicating that the reservation was unsuccessful.
- **Inputs**:
    - `galloc`: A graph allocator handle used to manage buffer allocations. Must be a valid, initialized ggml_gallocr_t object.
    - `graph`: A pointer to the computational graph for which buffers are to be reserved. Must not be null and should represent a valid graph structure.
- **Output**: Returns a boolean value: true if the buffer reservation was successful, false if it failed.
- **See also**: [`ggml_gallocr_reserve`](../src/ggml-alloc.c.driver.md#ggml_gallocr_reserve)  (Implementation)

### ggml\_gallocr\_reserve\_n<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_gallocr_reserve_n}} -->
Pre-allocates buffers for a graph using specified node and leaf buffer IDs.
- **Description**: Use this function to pre-allocate buffers for a computational graph, specifying which buffers to use for nodes and leaves. This is particularly useful for avoiding buffer reallocations when the graph's topology changes, especially when using multiple buffers. It should be called with a worst-case graph to ensure sufficient buffer allocation. The function returns false if buffer allocation fails, indicating that the specified buffers could not be reserved.
- **Inputs**:
    - `galloc`: A graph allocator handle used to manage buffer allocations. Must be a valid, initialized ggml_gallocr_t object.
    - `graph`: A pointer to a ggml_cgraph structure representing the computational graph for which buffers are to be reserved. Must not be null.
    - `node_buffer_ids`: An array of integers specifying the buffer IDs to be used for each node in the graph. The array must have at least as many elements as there are nodes in the graph.
    - `leaf_buffer_ids`: An array of integers specifying the buffer IDs to be used for each leaf in the graph. The array must have at least as many elements as there are leaves in the graph.
- **Output**: Returns true if the buffers were successfully reserved; false if buffer allocation failed.
- **See also**: [`ggml_gallocr_reserve_n`](../src/ggml-alloc.c.driver.md#ggml_gallocr_reserve_n)  (Implementation)

### ggml\_gallocr\_alloc\_graph<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_gallocr_alloc_graph}} -->
Allocate memory for a computational graph using a graph allocator.
- **Description**: This function allocates memory for the tensors in a computational graph using the specified graph allocator. It should be used when you have a graph that needs to be evaluated and you want to ensure that all necessary memory is allocated. If the graph allocator is configured with a single buffer, the function will automatically reallocate the buffer if needed. However, if multiple buffers are used, the function will not perform automatic reallocation, and you must call `ggml_gallocr_reserve_n` beforehand to set the node buffers. This function returns a boolean indicating success or failure of the allocation process.
- **Inputs**:
    - `galloc`: A graph allocator handle used to manage memory for the graph. It must be properly initialized before calling this function.
    - `graph`: A pointer to the computational graph for which memory is to be allocated. The graph must be constructed and valid before calling this function.
- **Output**: Returns true if the memory allocation was successful, or false if it failed, particularly in cases where multiple buffers are used and reallocation is needed.
- **See also**: [`ggml_gallocr_alloc_graph`](../src/ggml-alloc.c.driver.md#ggml_gallocr_alloc_graph)  (Implementation)

### ggml\_gallocr\_get\_buffer\_size<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_gallocr_get_buffer_size}} -->
Retrieve the size of a specified buffer in a graph allocator.
- **Description**: Use this function to obtain the size of a specific buffer managed by a graph allocator. It is useful for understanding memory usage or debugging allocation issues. The function should be called with a valid buffer identifier, which must be within the range of existing buffers in the allocator. If the buffer is not initialized or is a duplicate of a previously encountered buffer, the function returns zero, indicating no additional memory is allocated for this buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `galloc`: A graph allocator handle from which the buffer size is to be retrieved. The allocator must be properly initialized and must contain the buffer specified by buffer_id.
    - `buffer_id`: An integer representing the identifier of the buffer whose size is to be retrieved. It must be non-negative and less than the total number of buffers in the allocator. If the buffer_id is invalid, the function asserts and may terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns the size of the specified buffer in bytes. If the buffer is uninitialized or a duplicate, returns zero.
- **See also**: [`ggml_gallocr_get_buffer_size`](../src/ggml-alloc.c.driver.md#ggml_gallocr_get_buffer_size)  (Implementation)

### ggml\_backend\_alloc\_ctx\_tensors\_from\_buft<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_backend_alloc_ctx_tensors_from_buft}} -->
Allocate a buffer and allocate all tensors in a context using a specified buffer type.
- **Description**: This function is used to allocate a buffer for all tensors within a given ggml_context, using the specified buffer type. It should be called when you need to allocate memory for tensors that are not yet allocated within the context. The function assumes that the context is in a no-alloc state, meaning that no tensors have been allocated yet. It handles the allocation of tensors in chunks, respecting the maximum size and alignment constraints of the buffer type. If successful, it returns a buffer that contains all allocated tensors; otherwise, it returns NULL if allocation fails or if all tensors are already allocated.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A pointer to a ggml_context structure. This context must be in a no-alloc state, meaning no tensors should be allocated yet. The caller retains ownership and must ensure it is valid and not null.
    - `buft`: A ggml_backend_buffer_type_t specifying the type of buffer to use for allocation. It determines the alignment and maximum size constraints for the buffer. The caller retains ownership and must ensure it is valid.
- **Output**: Returns a ggml_backend_buffer_t representing the allocated buffer containing all tensors, or NULL if allocation fails or if all tensors are already allocated.
- **See also**: [`ggml_backend_alloc_ctx_tensors_from_buft`](../src/ggml-alloc.c.driver.md#ggml_backend_alloc_ctx_tensors_from_buft)  (Implementation)
