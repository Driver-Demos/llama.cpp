# Purpose
This C header file is designed to provide an interface for initializing and managing CUDA-based backends in a software system, potentially for machine learning or high-performance computing applications. It includes conditional compilation directives to support different GPU computing platforms, such as ROCm and MUSA, alongside the standard CUDA, by defining appropriate names for the libraries used. The file declares several functions for interacting with CUDA devices, including initializing the backend, checking if a backend is CUDA-based, managing device buffers, and retrieving device information such as memory and descriptions. Additionally, it provides functionality for registering and unregistering host buffers to facilitate efficient data transfer between CPU and GPU. The use of `extern "C"` ensures compatibility with C++ compilers, indicating that this header is intended for use in both C and C++ projects.
