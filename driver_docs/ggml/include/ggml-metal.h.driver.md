# Purpose
This C header file defines an interface for integrating the ggml library with Apple's Metal API, enabling GPU support for computational graphs on Apple devices. It provides a set of functions that allow user code to initialize the Metal backend, check for Metal support, and manage memory buffers and synchronization between CPU and GPU. The file includes functions for setting up abort callbacks, checking device compatibility with specific Metal feature families, and capturing command buffers for debugging or performance analysis. The interface is designed to be extensible, suggesting that similar backends could be developed for other GPU technologies like Vulkan or CUDA. The file also includes deprecated functions, indicating ongoing development and updates to the API.
