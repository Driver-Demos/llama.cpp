# Purpose
This C++ header file provides a narrow functionality focused on managing memory for specific types related to the "ggml" library, which appears to be a custom or third-party library. It defines smart pointers using `std::unique_ptr` for various `ggml` types, ensuring proper resource management and automatic deallocation through custom deleters. The code is intended to be included in other C++ source files, as indicated by the `#pragma once` directive and the inclusion of other headers like "ggml.h" and "ggml-backend.h". The use of smart pointers simplifies memory management by automatically freeing resources when they are no longer needed, thus preventing memory leaks and enhancing code safety and maintainability.

### ggml\_context\_deleter<!-- {{#data_structure:ggml_context_deleter}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Description**: The `ggml_context_deleter` is a custom deleter struct designed to be used with smart pointers, specifically `std::unique_ptr`, to manage the lifetime of `ggml_context` objects. It defines an `operator()` that takes a pointer to a `ggml_context` and calls `ggml_free` on it, ensuring that the context is properly deallocated when the smart pointer goes out of scope. This struct is part of a pattern to safely manage resources in C++ by automating memory management and preventing memory leaks.
