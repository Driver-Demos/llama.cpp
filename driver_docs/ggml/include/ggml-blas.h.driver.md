# Purpose
This C header file defines an interface for a backend API related to BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) operations within a larger software system, likely involving the GGML library. It includes function declarations for initializing a BLAS backend, checking if a given backend is BLAS, setting the number of threads for BLAS operations, and registering the BLAS backend. The use of `extern "C"` indicates that this header is compatible with C++ compilers, ensuring the functions have C linkage when used in C++ projects. The file serves as a bridge between the GGML library and BLAS operations, facilitating efficient linear algebra computations by leveraging multi-threading capabilities.

### ggml\_backend\_is\_blas<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_backend_is_blas}} -->
Check if the backend is a BLAS backend.
- **Description**: Use this function to determine if a given backend is configured to use the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) interface. This is useful when you need to verify that the backend supports BLAS operations, which can be important for performance optimizations in numerical computations. Ensure that the backend is properly initialized before calling this function. The function will return false if the backend is null or does not match the BLAS backend identifier.
- **Inputs**:
    - `backend`: A handle to a backend object. It must be a valid, non-null pointer to a backend initialized by the ggml library. If the backend is null, the function will return false.
- **Output**: Returns true if the backend is a BLAS backend, otherwise returns false.

### ggml\_backend\_blas\_set\_n\_threads<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_backend_blas_set_n_threads}} -->
Set the number of threads for BLAS operations.
- **Description**: This function configures the number of threads to be used for BLAS operations within the specified backend. It is particularly relevant for backends like OpenBLAS and BLIS, where the number of threads can significantly impact performance. This function should be called after initializing the backend with `ggml_backend_blas_init` and only if the backend is confirmed to be a BLAS backend using `ggml_backend_is_blas`. Adjusting the number of threads can help optimize performance based on the available hardware and workload characteristics.
- **Inputs**:
    - `backend_blas`: A handle to a BLAS backend, obtained from `ggml_backend_blas_init`. Must not be null and must represent a valid BLAS backend, as verified by `ggml_backend_is_blas`. The caller retains ownership.
    - `n_threads`: The number of threads to set for BLAS operations. Must be a positive integer. The function does not validate this parameter, so invalid values may lead to undefined behavior.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`ggml_backend_blas_set_n_threads`](../src/ggml-blas/ggml-blas.cpp.driver.md#ggml_backend_blas_set_n_threads)  (Implementation)
