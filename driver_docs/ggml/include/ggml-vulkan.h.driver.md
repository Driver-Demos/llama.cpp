# Purpose
This C header file defines an interface for a Vulkan-based backend within a larger system, likely related to graphics or compute operations. It includes function declarations for initializing the Vulkan backend, checking if a backend is Vulkan-based, and retrieving information about available Vulkan devices, such as their count, descriptions, and memory details. The file also defines constants for the Vulkan backend's name and a maximum number of devices, and it provides functions to determine buffer types for device and host memory interactions. The use of `extern "C"` ensures compatibility with C++ compilers, indicating that this header is intended for use in both C and C++ projects.

### ggml\_backend\_is\_vk<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_backend_is_vk}} -->
Check if a backend is a Vulkan backend.
- **Description**: Use this function to determine if a given backend is a Vulkan backend. This is useful when you need to verify the type of backend you are working with, especially in environments where multiple backend types may be present. Ensure that the backend parameter is not null before calling this function to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Inputs**:
    - `backend`: A handle to a backend object. Must not be null. If the backend is null, the function will return false.
- **Output**: Returns true if the backend is a Vulkan backend, otherwise returns false.
- **See also**: [`ggml_backend_is_vk`](../src/ggml-vulkan/ggml-vulkan.cpp.driver.md#ggml_backend_is_vk)  (Implementation)

### ggml\_backend\_vk\_get\_device\_count<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_backend_vk_get_device_count}} -->
Retrieve the number of available Vulkan devices.
- **Description**: Use this function to determine how many Vulkan-compatible devices are available on the system. This is typically called before initializing a Vulkan backend to ensure that there are devices available to use. The function does not require any parameters and will return an integer representing the count of devices. It is important to check this count before attempting to initialize or interact with Vulkan devices to avoid errors related to non-existent devices.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Output**: Returns an integer representing the number of Vulkan devices available on the system.
- **See also**: [`ggml_backend_vk_get_device_count`](../src/ggml-vulkan/ggml-vulkan.cpp.driver.md#ggml_backend_vk_get_device_count)  (Implementation)


---
### ggml\_backend\_vk\_get\_device\_description<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_backend_vk_get_device_description}} -->
Retrieves the description of a specified Vulkan device.
- **Description**: Use this function to obtain a human-readable description of a Vulkan device identified by its index. This function is useful for displaying device information to users or for logging purposes. Ensure that the device index is within the valid range, which is less than the total number of available Vulkan devices. The description is written into the provided buffer, which must be large enough to hold the description string. The function does not perform any validation on the buffer size, so it is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the buffer is adequately sized to prevent buffer overflows.
- **Inputs**:
    - `device`: The index of the Vulkan device for which the description is requested. Must be a non-negative integer less than the number of available Vulkan devices.
    - `description`: A pointer to a character buffer where the device description will be stored. Must not be null, and the caller is responsible for ensuring the buffer is large enough to hold the description.
    - `description_size`: The size of the description buffer in bytes. This should be large enough to store the entire device description string.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`ggml_backend_vk_get_device_description`](../src/ggml-vulkan/ggml-vulkan.cpp.driver.md#ggml_backend_vk_get_device_description)  (Implementation)

### ggml\_backend\_vk\_get\_device\_memory<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_backend_vk_get_device_memory}} -->
Retrieve the total and free device memory for a specified Vulkan device.
- **Description**: Use this function to obtain the total and free memory available on a specified Vulkan device. This is useful for managing resources and ensuring that sufficient memory is available for operations. The function must be called with a valid device index, which should be less than the total number of available Vulkan devices. The function writes the total and free memory sizes to the provided pointers, which must not be null.
- **Inputs**:
    - `device`: The index of the Vulkan device for which memory information is requested. Must be a valid index less than the number of available devices.
    - `free`: A pointer to a size_t variable where the function will store the amount of free memory on the device. Must not be null.
    - `total`: A pointer to a size_t variable where the function will store the total memory size of the device. Must not be null.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`ggml_backend_vk_get_device_memory`](../src/ggml-vulkan/ggml-vulkan.cpp.driver.md#ggml_backend_vk_get_device_memory)  (Implementation)
