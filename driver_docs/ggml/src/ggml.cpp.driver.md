# Purpose
This C++ code is part of a library or module, likely intended to be imported and used elsewhere, as it does not contain a `main` function and includes a header file "ggml-impl.h". It provides narrow functionality focused on handling uncaught exceptions by setting a custom terminate handler, [`ggml_uncaught_exception`](#ggml_uncaught_exception), which prints a backtrace and then calls the previous terminate handler if it exists. The code also includes a static initialization block that checks an environment variable, `GGML_NO_BACKTRACE`, to conditionally disable the backtrace feature. This setup is useful for debugging purposes, allowing developers to trace the call stack when an unhandled exception occurs, unless explicitly disabled by the environment variable.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `ggml-impl.h`
- `cstdlib`
- `exception`


# Global Variables

---
### previous\_terminate\_handler
- **Type**: `std::terminate_handler`
- **Description**: The `previous_terminate_handler` is a static global variable of type `std::terminate_handler`, which is a function pointer type used to handle termination in C++ programs. It stores the previous termination handler before it is replaced by a custom handler `ggml_uncaught_exception`. This allows the program to restore the original handler if needed.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store the original termination handler so that it can be called if the custom handler `ggml_uncaught_exception` is invoked.


---
### ggml\_uncaught\_exception\_init
- **Type**: `bool`
- **Description**: The `ggml_uncaught_exception_init` is a static boolean variable that is initialized using a lambda function. This lambda function checks for the presence of an environment variable `GGML_NO_BACKTRACE` and, if not set, replaces the current terminate handler with `ggml_uncaught_exception`, storing the previous handler for later use.
- **Use**: This variable is used to initialize the custom terminate handler for uncaught exceptions, enabling backtrace printing unless disabled by an environment variable.


# Functions

---
### ggml\_uncaught\_exception<!-- {{#callable:ggml_uncaught_exception}} -->
The `ggml_uncaught_exception` function handles uncaught exceptions by printing a backtrace, invoking a previous terminate handler if it exists, and aborting the program.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `ggml_print_backtrace()` to print the backtrace of the current call stack.
    - Check if `previous_terminate_handler` is not null.
    - If `previous_terminate_handler` is not null, call it.
    - Call `abort()` to terminate the program, which is only reachable if `previous_terminate_handler` was null.
- **Output**: This function does not return any value as it is marked with `GGML_NORETURN`, indicating it will not return to the caller.
