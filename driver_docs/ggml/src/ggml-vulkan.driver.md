## Folders
- **[cmake](ggml-vulkan/cmake.driver.md)**: The `cmake` folder in the `llama.cpp` codebase contains configuration files for setting up build settings, including compiler options and output directories, as exemplified by the `host-toolchain.cmake.in` file.
- **[vulkan-shaders](ggml-vulkan/vulkan-shaders.driver.md)**: The `vulkan-shaders` folder in the `llama.cpp` codebase contains a comprehensive collection of Vulkan compute shaders and related configuration files for performing various mathematical, data processing, and machine learning operations, including dequantization, matrix multiplication, activation functions, and more, all optimized for parallel execution on GPU hardware.

## Files
- **[CMakeLists.txt](ggml-vulkan/CMakeLists.txt.driver.md)**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `llama.cpp/ggml/src/ggml-vulkan` directory configures the build process for the Vulkan backend of the `ggml` library, including detecting host compilers, testing shader extension support, and setting up shader generation using `ExternalProject_Add`.
- **[ggml-vulkan.cpp](ggml-vulkan/ggml-vulkan.cpp.driver.md)**: The `ggml-vulkan.cpp` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase implements a Vulkan-based backend for the GGML machine learning framework, providing high-performance GPU computations for tensor operations such as matrix multiplications, element-wise operations, and neural network tasks, with extensive support for resource management, synchronization, and debugging tools.
