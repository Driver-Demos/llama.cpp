## Files
- **[acl_tensor.cpp](ggml-cann/acl_tensor.cpp.driver.md)**: The `acl_tensor.cpp` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase provides functions for creating and managing ACL tensors, including type mapping, tensor creation with broadcasting support, and determining broadcast shapes for tensor operations.
- **[acl_tensor.h](ggml-cann/acl_tensor.h.driver.md)**: The `acl_tensor.h` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase provides functions and templates for creating and managing ACL tensors, including type mapping, tensor creation with optional shapes, broadcasting checks, and calculating broadcast shapes for element-wise operations and matrix multiplication.
- **[aclnn_ops.cpp](ggml-cann/aclnn_ops.cpp.driver.md)**: The `aclnn_ops.cpp` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase provides a comprehensive implementation of various tensor operations using the CANN backend, including arithmetic operations, pooling, normalization, matrix multiplication, and more, with support for both floating-point and quantized data types.
- **[aclnn_ops.h](ggml-cann/aclnn_ops.h.driver.md)**: The `aclnn_ops.h` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase provides a comprehensive set of function declarations and utilities for performing various tensor operations using the CANN backend, including element-wise operations, matrix multiplications, normalization techniques, and activation functions, all optimized for high-performance execution.
- **[CMakeLists.txt](ggml-cann/CMakeLists.txt.driver.md)**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `llama.cpp/ggml/src/ggml-cann` directory configures the build process for the CANN backend, including detecting the Ascend SoC type, setting necessary directories and libraries, and ensuring compatibility with supported platforms.
- **[common.h](ggml-cann/common.h.driver.md)**: The `common.h` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase provides definitions and implementations for managing CANN (Compute Architecture for Neural Networks) devices, including error handling, device information, memory pool management, task queue operations, and backend context for CANN operations.
- **[Doxyfile](ggml-cann/Doxyfile.driver.md)**: The `Doxyfile` in the `llama.cpp` codebase, located at `ggml-cann/Doxyfile.driver.md`, is a configuration file for the Doxygen documentation system, specifying settings for generating documentation for the `ggml` project, a tensor library for machine learning.
- **[ggml-cann.cpp](ggml-cann/ggml-cann.cpp.driver.md)**: The `ggml-cann.cpp` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase provides an implementation for managing CANN (Compute Architecture for Neural Networks) operations, including device initialization, memory management, buffer pooling, tensor transformations, and backend operations for neural network computations.
