# Purpose
This code is a C header file that declares a set of functions for performing basic arithmetic operations on tensors, specifically addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The functions are designed to work with a structure named `ggml_compute_params` and a `ggml_tensor`, which are likely defined in the included "common.h" file. The use of `#pragma once` ensures the file is included only once during compilation, preventing duplicate definitions. The `extern "C"` block indicates that the functions have C linkage, allowing them to be used in C++ programs without name mangling issues. This header file is part of a larger library or framework that deals with tensor computations, possibly for machine learning or numerical analysis applications.

### ggml\_compute\_forward\_add\_non\_quantized<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_compute_forward_add_non_quantized}} -->
Performs element-wise addition on tensors without quantization.
- **Description**: This function executes an element-wise addition operation on tensors, storing the result in the destination tensor. It is intended for use in scenarios where quantization is not applied to the tensor data. The function must be called with valid compute parameters and a destination tensor that is properly initialized. It is typically used in neural network computations or other mathematical operations involving tensors.
- **Inputs**:
    - `params`: A pointer to a ggml_compute_params structure containing the parameters for the computation. This must not be null and should be properly initialized before calling the function.
    - `dst`: A pointer to a ggml_tensor structure where the result of the addition will be stored. This must not be null and should be initialized to the appropriate size and type to hold the result of the operation.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`ggml_compute_forward_add_non_quantized`](binary-ops.cpp.driver.md#ggml_compute_forward_add_non_quantized)  (Implementation)

### ggml\_compute\_forward\_sub<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_compute_forward_sub}} -->
Performs element-wise subtraction on tensors.
- **Description**: This function executes an element-wise subtraction operation on tensors, storing the result in the destination tensor. It is intended to be used in a context where tensor operations are performed, and it requires valid compute parameters and a destination tensor. The function should be called when a subtraction operation is needed as part of a larger computation graph or neural network operation. Ensure that the destination tensor is properly initialized and has the appropriate dimensions to store the result of the subtraction.
- **Inputs**:
    - `params`: A pointer to a ggml_compute_params structure containing the parameters for the computation. This must not be null and should be properly initialized before calling the function.
    - `dst`: A pointer to a ggml_tensor structure where the result of the subtraction will be stored. This must not be null and should be allocated with sufficient space to hold the result of the operation.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`ggml_compute_forward_sub`](binary-ops.cpp.driver.md#ggml_compute_forward_sub)  (Implementation)

### ggml\_compute\_forward\_mul<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_compute_forward_mul}} -->
Performs element-wise multiplication on tensors.
- **Description**: This function is used to perform an element-wise multiplication operation on tensors, storing the result in the destination tensor. It is typically called when a multiplication operation is needed as part of a larger computation graph or neural network operation. The function requires valid compute parameters and a destination tensor to store the results. It is important to ensure that the destination tensor is properly initialized and has the appropriate dimensions to store the result of the multiplication.
- **Inputs**:
    - `params`: A pointer to a `ggml_compute_params` structure containing the parameters for the computation. This must not be null and should be properly initialized before calling the function.
    - `dst`: A pointer to a `ggml_tensor` structure where the result of the multiplication will be stored. This tensor must be initialized and have the correct dimensions to hold the result. The caller retains ownership of this tensor.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`ggml_compute_forward_mul`](binary-ops.cpp.driver.md#ggml_compute_forward_mul)  (Implementation)

### ggml\_compute\_forward\_div<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_compute_forward_div}} -->
Performs element-wise division on tensors.
- **Description**: This function executes an element-wise division operation on tensors, storing the result in the destination tensor. It is intended to be used in scenarios where tensor division is required as part of a computation graph. The function must be called with valid compute parameters and a destination tensor that is properly initialized. The operation assumes that the input tensors are compatible for element-wise operations, meaning they should have the same shape or be broadcastable. The function does not handle division by zero explicitly, so care should be taken to ensure that the divisor tensor does not contain zero values.
- **Inputs**:
    - `params`: A pointer to a ggml_compute_params structure containing the parameters for the computation. Must not be null. The caller retains ownership.
    - `dst`: A pointer to a ggml_tensor structure where the result of the division will be stored. Must not be null and should be properly initialized before calling the function. The caller retains ownership.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`ggml_compute_forward_div`](binary-ops.cpp.driver.md#ggml_compute_forward_div)  (Implementation)
