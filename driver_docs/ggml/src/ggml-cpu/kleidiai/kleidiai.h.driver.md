# Purpose
This code is a C header file that provides a function declaration for use in a C or C++ program. It includes a preprocessor directive `#pragma once` to ensure the file is included only once in a single compilation, preventing duplicate definitions. The file declares a function [`ggml_backend_cpu_kleidiai_buffer_type`](#ggml_backend_cpu_kleidiai_buffer_type) that returns a value of type `ggml_backend_buffer_type_t`, which is likely defined in the included header file "ggml-alloc.h". The use of `extern "C"` ensures that the function can be linked correctly when used in C++ programs by preventing name mangling. The file is part of a project by Arm Limited, as indicated by the copyright notice and the MIT license specified in the comments.

### ggml\_backend\_cpu\_kleidiai\_buffer\_type<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_backend_cpu_kleidiai_buffer_type}} -->
Retrieve the buffer type for the CPU Kleidiai backend.
- **Description**: This function provides access to the buffer type associated with the CPU Kleidiai backend, which is part of the GGML library. It should be called when there is a need to interact with or allocate buffers specific to this backend. The function initializes the necessary context for the Kleidiai backend if it has not been initialized already. It is intended for use in environments where the GGML library is managing memory buffers for CPU operations.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to a `ggml_backend_buffer_type_t` structure representing the buffer type for the CPU Kleidiai backend.
- **See also**: [`ggml_backend_cpu_kleidiai_buffer_type`](kleidiai.cpp.driver.md#ggml_backend_cpu_kleidiai_buffer_type)  (Implementation)
