# Purpose
This C++ source code file is part of a library that provides specialized micro-kernels for matrix multiplication operations, specifically optimized for ARM architectures. The file includes a series of header files that define interfaces and implementations for various matrix multiplication (GEMM) and vector multiplication (GEMV) operations, utilizing different data types and CPU features such as SME (Scalable Matrix Extension), DOTPROD (Dot Product), and i8mm (Integer 8-bit Matrix Multiplication). The code is structured to select the most appropriate kernel based on the available CPU features and the data types of the matrices involved in the operation.

The primary functionality of this file is to define and manage a collection of matrix multiplication kernels, each tailored for specific ARM CPU features and data types. It includes logic to select the optimal kernel for a given operation, ensuring efficient execution by leveraging hardware-specific optimizations. The file does not define a public API directly but serves as an internal component of a larger library, facilitating high-performance matrix operations by abstracting the complexity of kernel selection and execution. The use of preprocessor directives ensures that the correct kernels are compiled and used based on the target platform's capabilities, making the library adaptable to various ARM-based systems.

# Functions

---
### ggml\_kleidiai\_select\_kernels<!-- {{#callable:ggml_kleidiai_select_kernels}} -->
The function `ggml_kleidiai_select_kernels` selects an appropriate micro-kernel for matrix multiplication based on CPU features and tensor types.
- **Inputs**:
    - `cpu_features`: A bitmask representing the CPU features available on the current hardware.
    - `tensor`: A pointer to a `ggml_tensor` structure, which contains information about the operation type and source tensors involved in the computation.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a pointer `kernel` to `nullptr`.
    - Check if the tensor operation is `GGML_OP_MUL_MAT` and both source tensors are not `nullptr`.
    - Iterate over the `gemm_gemv_kernels` array to find a kernel that matches the required CPU features, left-hand side type, right-hand side type, and operation type of the tensor.
    - If a matching kernel is found, assign its address to `kernel` and break the loop.
    - Return the selected `kernel` pointer.
- **Output**: A pointer to a `ggml_kleidiai_kernels` structure that matches the specified CPU features and tensor types, or `nullptr` if no suitable kernel is found.

### ggml\_kleidiai\_select\_kernels\_q4\_0<!-- {{#callable:ggml_kleidiai_select_kernels_q4_0}} -->
The function `ggml_kleidiai_select_kernels_q4_0` selects and returns a pointer to the first kernel from a predefined list that matches the required CPU features.
- **Inputs**:
    - `features`: A bitmask of CPU features that the selected kernel must support.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a pointer `kernels` to `nullptr`.
    - Iterate over each element in the `gemm_gemv_kernels` array.
    - For each kernel, check if the CPU features required by the kernel are supported by the input `features`.
    - If a matching kernel is found, set `kernels` to point to this kernel and break the loop.
    - Return the `kernels` pointer, which is either `nullptr` or points to the first matching kernel.
- **Output**: A pointer to a `ggml_kleidiai_kernels` structure that matches the required CPU features, or `nullptr` if no match is found.
