# Purpose
This C++ header file defines a set of structures and functions related to kernel operations, specifically for matrix multiplication and vector operations, which are optimized based on CPU features. The file includes enumerations for different CPU features, such as DOTPROD, I8MM, SVE, and SME, and provides overloaded operators to facilitate bitwise operations on these features. The primary structures defined are `kernel_info`, `lhs_packing_info`, `rhs_packing_info`, and `ggml_kleidiai_kernels`, each encapsulating various function pointers and `std::variant` types to handle different function signatures for operations like packing and running kernels. These structures are designed to support flexible and efficient execution of matrix operations by allowing different implementations to be selected based on the CPU capabilities and data types involved.

The file also declares two functions, `ggml_kleidiai_select_kernels` and `ggml_kleidiai_select_kernels_q4_0`, which are responsible for selecting the appropriate kernel configurations based on the available CPU features and tensor types. This suggests that the code is part of a larger library or framework, likely related to numerical computing or machine learning, where performance optimization is critical. The use of `std::variant` and `std::function` indicates a design that prioritizes flexibility and extensibility, allowing for different kernel implementations to be easily integrated and selected at runtime. The inclusion of the "ggml.h" header suggests that this file is part of a system that interfaces with or extends the functionality provided by the GGML library, which is known for its focus on efficient tensor operations.
