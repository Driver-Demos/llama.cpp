# Purpose
This C++ source code file is designed to provide functionality for managing high-bandwidth memory (HBM) buffers on a CPU, specifically when the `GGML_USE_CPU_HBM` preprocessor directive is defined. The file includes several header files that suggest it is part of a larger library or framework related to memory management and backend implementations, such as `ggml-backend.h`, `ggml-cpu.h`, and `ggml-cpu-hbm.h`. The primary focus of this code is to define and implement functions for allocating, freeing, and managing HBM buffers, which are used to optimize memory operations by leveraging high-bandwidth memory capabilities.

The code defines a specific buffer type, "CPU_HBM," and provides implementations for key operations such as buffer allocation and deallocation using the `hbwmalloc` library, which is specialized for high-bandwidth memory management. The functions [`ggml_backend_cpu_hbm_buffer_type_alloc_buffer`](#ggml_backend_cpu_hbm_buffer_type_alloc_buffer) and [`ggml_backend_cpu_hbm_buffer_free_buffer`](#ggml_backend_cpu_hbm_buffer_free_buffer) are central to this functionality, handling the allocation and freeing of memory, respectively. The code also defines a structure, `ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_type_hbm`, which encapsulates the interface for this buffer type, including function pointers for operations like getting the buffer's name and alignment. This file is likely part of a modular system where different memory management strategies can be plugged in, and it provides a specific implementation for systems that support HBM on CPUs.

# Functions

---
### ggml\_backend\_cpu\_hbm\_buffer\_type\_get\_name<!-- {{#callable:ggml_backend_cpu_hbm_buffer_type_get_name}} -->
The function `ggml_backend_cpu_hbm_buffer_type_get_name` returns the name of the buffer type as a string, specifically "CPU_HBM".
- **Inputs**:
    - `buft`: A parameter of type `ggml_backend_buffer_type_t`, representing the buffer type, which is not used in the function.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function immediately returns the string "CPU_HBM".
    - The parameter `buft` is marked as unused with the macro `GGML_UNUSED(buft)`.
- **Output**: The function returns a constant string "CPU_HBM".


---
### ggml\_backend\_cpu\_hbm\_buffer\_free\_buffer<!-- {{#callable:ggml_backend_cpu_hbm_buffer_free_buffer}} -->
The function `ggml_backend_cpu_hbm_buffer_free_buffer` releases memory allocated for a buffer using the high bandwidth memory (HBM) allocation method.
- **Inputs**:
    - `buffer`: A `ggml_backend_buffer_t` type representing the buffer whose memory is to be freed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls `hbw_free` with the `context` member of the `buffer` to release the allocated memory.
- **Output**: This function does not return any value.


---
### ggml\_backend\_cpu\_hbm\_buffer\_type\_alloc\_buffer<!-- {{#callable:ggml_backend_cpu_hbm_buffer_type_alloc_buffer}} -->
The function `ggml_backend_cpu_hbm_buffer_type_alloc_buffer` allocates a high-bandwidth memory (HBM) buffer of a specified size and type, and returns a buffer object.
- **Inputs**:
    - `buft`: The type of the buffer to be allocated, represented by `ggml_backend_buffer_type_t`.
    - `size`: The size of the buffer to be allocated, specified as a `size_t` value.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function attempts to allocate memory using `hbw_posix_memalign`, which aligns the memory according to the alignment requirements of the buffer type `buft` and allocates `size` bytes.
    - If the memory allocation fails (indicated by a non-zero result from `hbw_posix_memalign`), an error message is logged and the function returns `NULL`.
    - If the memory allocation is successful, a buffer object is created using `ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_from_ptr`, which takes the allocated pointer and size as arguments.
    - The buffer type `buft` is assigned to the buffer object.
    - The buffer's `free_buffer` interface is set to `ggml_backend_cpu_hbm_buffer_free_buffer`, which is responsible for freeing the allocated memory.
    - The function returns the created buffer object.
- **Output**: A `ggml_backend_buffer_t` object representing the allocated buffer, or `NULL` if the allocation fails.


---
### ggml\_backend\_cpu\_hbm\_buffer\_type<!-- {{#callable:ggml_backend_cpu_hbm_buffer_type}} -->
The function `ggml_backend_cpu_hbm_buffer_type` returns a static structure representing the buffer type for CPU High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) with specific interface functions for buffer management.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function defines a static structure `ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_type_hbm` of type `ggml_backend_buffer_type` with initialized interface functions for buffer management.
    - The interface includes functions for getting the buffer name, allocating a buffer, getting buffer alignment, and checking if the buffer is host memory.
    - The `get_max_size` and `get_alloc_size` functions are set to `nullptr`, indicating default behaviors.
    - The function returns a pointer to the static structure `ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_type_hbm`.
- **Output**: A pointer to a static `ggml_backend_buffer_type` structure configured for CPU HBM buffer management.
