# Purpose
This C++ header file provides specialized functionality for parallel computing and quantized type support, particularly in environments that may utilize OpenMP for parallelization and AMX (Advanced Matrix Extensions) for optimized matrix operations. The file includes essential headers such as "ggml.h" and "ggml-cpu-impl.h," indicating its integration with a larger library or framework, likely related to machine learning or numerical computations. The file defines several constants and macros, such as TILE_M, TILE_N, TILE_K, and AMX_BLK_SIZE, which are likely used to configure the dimensions of matrix tiles and blocks for efficient computation.

The file contains template functions for parallel execution, such as [`parallel_for`](#parallel_for) and [`parallel_for_ggml`](#parallel_for_ggml), which distribute work across multiple threads, leveraging OpenMP if available. These functions use a partitioning strategy to balance workloads, ensuring efficient utilization of computational resources. Additionally, the file defines a function [`qtype_has_amx_kernels`](#qtype_has_amx_kernels) to check if specific quantized data types have support for AMX kernels, which suggests its role in optimizing operations for certain data types. Overall, this header file is a component of a larger system, providing parallel processing utilities and support for specific quantized types, enhancing performance in computationally intensive applications.

# Functions

---
### div\_up<!-- {{#callable:div_up}} -->
The `div_up` function performs integer division of two integral values, rounding up to the nearest whole number.
- **Inputs**:
    - `x`: The dividend, an integral value to be divided.
    - `y`: The divisor, an integral value by which the dividend is divided.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function adds the divisor minus one to the dividend to ensure rounding up when performing integer division.
    - It then performs the division of the adjusted dividend by the divisor.
- **Output**: The function returns the result of the division, which is an integral value representing the ceiling of the division of x by y.

### balance211<!-- {{#callable:balance211}} -->
The `balance211` function partitions a workload `n` among `nth` threads, determining the start and end indices for the `ith` thread.
- **Inputs**:
    - `n`: The total workload or number of tasks to be partitioned.
    - `nth`: The total number of threads among which the workload is to be distributed.
    - `ith`: The index of the current thread for which the workload partition is being calculated.
    - `n_start`: A reference to a variable where the start index of the workload for the `ith` thread will be stored.
    - `n_end`: A reference to a variable where the end index of the workload for the `ith` thread will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses a preprocessor directive to choose between two partitioning patterns: onednn and pytorch aten.
    - In the pytorch aten pattern, the workload for each thread is calculated using the [`div_up`](#div_up) function to determine `n_my`, the number of tasks per thread.
    - The start index `n_start` is calculated as `ith * n_my`.
    - The end index `n_end` is calculated as the minimum of `n_start + n_my` and `n`, ensuring it does not exceed the total workload.
- **Output**: The function outputs the start (`n_start`) and end (`n_end`) indices for the workload assigned to the `ith` thread.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`div_up`](#div_up)


---
### parallel\_for<!-- {{#callable:parallel_for}} -->
The `parallel_for` function executes a given function in parallel over a specified range, utilizing OpenMP if available.
- **Inputs**:
    - `n`: The total number of iterations or the range over which the function `f` should be executed.
    - `f`: A callable function or functor that takes two integer arguments, representing the start and end of the range to process.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if OpenMP is enabled with the `GGML_USE_OPENMP` macro.
    - If OpenMP is enabled, execute the code block within `#pragma omp parallel` to run in parallel.
    - Inside the parallel block, retrieve the number of threads (`nth`) and the current thread number (`ith`).
    - Use the [`balance211`](#balance211) function to determine the start (`tbegin`) and end (`tend`) indices for the current thread's workload.
    - Invoke the function `f` with the calculated `tbegin` and `tend` to process the assigned range.
    - If OpenMP is not enabled, call the function `f` with the full range from 0 to `n`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it executes the provided function `f` over the specified range, potentially in parallel.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`balance211`](#balance211)

### parallel\_for\_ggml<!-- {{#callable:parallel_for_ggml}} -->
The `parallel_for_ggml` function executes a given function in parallel over a specified range, using parameters to determine the workload distribution among threads.
- **Inputs**:
    - `params`: A pointer to a `ggml_compute_params` structure that contains the number of threads (`nth`) and the index of the current thread (`ith`).
    - `n`: An integer representing the total number of iterations or tasks to be distributed among threads.
    - `f`: A callable function or functor that takes two integer arguments, representing the start and end indices of the range to process.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calculates the start (`tbegin`) and end (`tend`) indices for the current thread using the [`balance211`](#balance211) function, which distributes the workload based on the total number of tasks (`n`), the number of threads (`nth`), and the current thread index (`ith`).
    - The provided function `f` is then called with the calculated `tbegin` and `tend` indices, allowing it to process the assigned range.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it executes the provided function `f` over the specified range for the current thread.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`balance211`](#balance211)

### qtype\_has\_amx\_kernels<!-- {{#callable:qtype_has_amx_kernels}} -->
The function `qtype_has_amx_kernels` checks if a given quantized type has support for AMX kernels.
- **Inputs**:
    - `type`: An enumeration value of type `ggml_type` representing a specific quantized type.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function evaluates if the input `type` matches any of the predefined quantized types that support AMX kernels.
    - It returns `true` if the `type` is one of the following: `GGML_TYPE_Q4_0`, `GGML_TYPE_Q4_1`, `GGML_TYPE_Q8_0`, `GGML_TYPE_Q4_K`, `GGML_TYPE_Q5_K`, `GGML_TYPE_Q6_K`, or `GGML_TYPE_IQ4_XS`.
    - If the `type` does not match any of these, the function returns `false`.
- **Output**: A boolean value indicating whether the specified quantized type has AMX kernel support.
