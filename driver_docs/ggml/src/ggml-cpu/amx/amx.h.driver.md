# Purpose
This code is a simple C header file intended for internal use within the GGML (General Graph Machine Learning) library. It includes two other headers, `ggml-backend.h` and `ggml-cpu-impl.h`, suggesting it is part of a larger system dealing with backend and CPU-specific implementations. The file conditionally declares a function, [`ggml_backend_amx_buffer_type`](#ggml_backend_amx_buffer_type), which is only available if the compiler supports both the `__AMX_INT8__` and `__AVX512VNNI__` instruction sets, indicating that this function is likely related to optimizing operations for specific hardware capabilities. The use of conditional compilation ensures that the function is only declared when the necessary hardware features are present, enhancing the library's adaptability to different CPU architectures.

### ggml\_backend\_amx\_buffer\_type<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_backend_amx_buffer_type}} -->
Retrieve the buffer type for AMX backend if supported.
- **Description**: This function provides access to the buffer type specific to the AMX backend, which is available only if the hardware supports AMX INT8 and AVX512VNNI instructions. It should be called to obtain a buffer type that can be used with AMX-optimized operations. The function checks for the necessary hardware support and initialization before returning the buffer type. If the hardware does not support the required features or initialization fails, the function returns a null pointer.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to a `ggml_backend_buffer_type_t` representing the AMX buffer type, or `nullptr` if the required hardware support is not available or initialization fails.
