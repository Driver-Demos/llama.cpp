# Purpose
This C++ source code file provides a specialized implementation for performing binary operations on tensors, specifically addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The file defines inline functions for these basic arithmetic operations and uses template functions to apply these operations to tensors of various data types, including float, half-precision float (F16), and bfloat16 (BF16). The code is structured to handle both contiguous and non-contiguous data layouts, ensuring flexibility in tensor operations. It also includes conditional compilation to leverage the Accelerate framework for optimized vector operations on macOS systems, enhancing performance for floating-point operations.

The file is part of a larger library or application, likely related to machine learning or numerical computing, given its focus on tensor operations. It defines public APIs for computing forward operations on tensors, such as [`ggml_compute_forward_add_non_quantized`](#ggml_compute_forward_add_non_quantized), [`ggml_compute_forward_sub`](#ggml_compute_forward_sub), [`ggml_compute_forward_mul`](#ggml_compute_forward_mul), and [`ggml_compute_forward_div`](#ggml_compute_forward_div). These functions serve as entry points for performing the respective binary operations on tensors, abstracting the underlying complexity of data type handling and memory layout. The code ensures type safety and compatibility by checking tensor types and shapes before applying operations, and it uses a type conversion table to facilitate operations across different data types.
