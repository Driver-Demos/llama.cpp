# Purpose
This code is a C header file intended for internal use within a project that utilizes the GGML (General Graphical Machine Learning) library. It includes two other headers, "ggml-backend.h" and "ggml.h", suggesting it relies on definitions and declarations from these files, likely related to backend operations and core GGML functionalities. The file declares a single function, [`ggml_backend_cpu_hbm_buffer_type`](#ggml_backend_cpu_hbm_buffer_type), which presumably returns a value of type `ggml_backend_buffer_type_t`. This function likely determines or specifies the type of buffer used for CPU operations within the GGML backend, possibly related to high-bandwidth memory (HBM) management. The use of `#pragma once` ensures the file is included only once during compilation, preventing duplicate definitions.

### ggml\_backend\_cpu\_hbm\_buffer\_type<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_backend_cpu_hbm_buffer_type}} -->
Retrieve the buffer type for CPU high-bandwidth memory.
- **Description**: Use this function to obtain a reference to the buffer type structure specifically designed for CPU high-bandwidth memory (HBM) operations. This function is typically used in scenarios where high-performance memory operations are required on the CPU. It provides access to a set of function pointers and properties that define how buffers of this type are managed, including allocation and alignment. The function returns a static reference, ensuring that the same buffer type structure is used throughout the application.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to a static `ggml_backend_buffer_type` structure configured for CPU high-bandwidth memory operations.
- **See also**: [`ggml_backend_cpu_hbm_buffer_type`](ggml-cpu-hbm.cpp.driver.md#ggml_backend_cpu_hbm_buffer_type)  (Implementation)
