# Purpose
This code is a C header file intended for internal use within the GGML library, which is likely a machine learning or numerical computation library given the context. The file includes two other headers, "ggml-cpu-traits.h" and "ggml.h", suggesting it relies on CPU-specific traits and core GGML functionalities. It declares a function, [`ggml_backend_cpu_aarch64_buffer_type`](#ggml_backend_cpu_aarch64_buffer_type), which likely determines or returns the type of buffer used for the AArch64 architecture, a common architecture for ARM CPUs. The use of `#pragma once` ensures the file is included only once during compilation, preventing duplicate definitions.

### ggml\_backend\_cpu\_aarch64\_buffer\_type<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_backend_cpu_aarch64_buffer_type}} -->
Returns the buffer type for the AArch64 CPU backend.
- **Description**: Use this function to obtain the buffer type specific to the AArch64 CPU backend within the GGML framework. This function is intended for internal use and provides a static buffer type structure that includes function pointers for buffer management operations such as allocation and alignment. It is essential for managing memory buffers in a manner optimized for AArch64 architecture. The function does not require any parameters and is expected to be called when the buffer type for AArch64 is needed.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to a static `ggml_backend_buffer_type` structure configured for AArch64 CPU backend operations.
- **See also**: [`ggml_backend_cpu_aarch64_buffer_type`](ggml-cpu-aarch64.cpp.driver.md#ggml_backend_cpu_aarch64_buffer_type)  (Implementation)
