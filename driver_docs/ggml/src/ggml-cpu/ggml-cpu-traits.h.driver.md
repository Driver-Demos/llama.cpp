# Purpose
This C++ header file provides a narrow functionality focused on extending the capabilities of a CPU-based backend for a machine learning library, likely related to tensor operations. It defines interfaces and functions for handling additional computational tasks, referred to as "extra" operations, which may be part of an accelerator. The file includes function declarations for determining if an operation is part of this extra set and for calculating the work size required for such operations. It also declares two abstract classes, `tensor_traits` and `extra_buffer_type`, which are intended to be implemented elsewhere, likely in a corresponding source file (e.g., `ggml-cpu.cpp`). These classes provide a framework for defining how specific tensor operations are supported and executed on the CPU, suggesting that this header is part of a larger library intended to be imported and used in other parts of a software system.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `ggml-backend-impl.h`
- `ggml-cpu-impl.h`
- `ggml.h`
- `vector`


# Global Variables

---
### ggml\_backend\_cpu\_get\_extra\_buffers\_type
- **Type**: `std::vector<ggml_backend_buffer_type_t> &`
- **Description**: The variable `ggml_backend_cpu_get_extra_buffers_type` is a function that returns a reference to a `std::vector` containing elements of type `ggml_backend_buffer_type_t`. This vector is likely used to manage or store different types of backend buffer types that are specific to the CPU implementation of the GGML library.
- **Use**: This variable is used to retrieve and possibly manipulate a collection of backend buffer types for CPU operations within the GGML library.


# Data Structures

---
### tensor\_traits<!-- {{#data_structure:tensor_traits}} -->
- **Type**: `class`
- **Description**: The `tensor_traits` class is an abstract base class within the `ggml::cpu` namespace, designed to define a common interface for tensor operations in a CPU context. It includes two pure virtual functions: `work_size`, which calculates the required work size for a given operation and number of threads, and `compute_forward`, which performs the forward computation for a given tensor operation. This class is intended to be subclassed to provide specific implementations for different tensor operations.


---
### extra\_buffer\_type<!-- {{#data_structure:extra_buffer_type}} -->
- **Type**: `class`
- **Description**: The `extra_buffer_type` class is an abstract class within the `ggml::cpu` namespace, designed to represent a type of buffer that can be used with specific operations in a backend device. It contains two pure virtual functions: `supports_op`, which checks if a given operation is supported by the buffer type on a specified backend device, and `get_tensor_traits`, which retrieves the traits of a tensor for a given operation. This class serves as a base for implementing specific buffer types that can handle operations in a CPU-based machine learning framework.
