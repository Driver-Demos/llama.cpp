# Purpose
This C header file is an internal component of the GGML library, specifically designed for CPU-based operations. It provides a collection of function declarations focused on quantization and dot product operations, which are essential for efficient numerical computations, particularly in machine learning and data processing contexts. The file includes functions for quantizing data from floating-point representations to various lower-bit formats (e.g., q4, q5, q8), which can significantly reduce memory usage and improve processing speed. These quantization functions are tailored for different bit-widths and configurations, allowing for flexible optimization strategies depending on the application's precision and performance requirements.

Additionally, the file declares functions for performing dot product operations between quantized vectors. These functions are crucial for operations such as matrix multiplications and neural network computations, where dot products are a fundamental operation. The use of `GGML_RESTRICT` hints at optimizations for memory access patterns, ensuring efficient execution. The presence of `extern "C"` blocks indicates compatibility with C++ compilers, allowing these functions to be used in C++ projects. This header does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly but serves as an internal utility to support the broader functionality of the GGML library.

    - `vy`: A pointer to the second input vector, which is quantized in the q8_0 format. Must not be null.
    - `by`: A size parameter that is not used in the function and can be ignored.
    - `nrc`: Must be set to 1. This is a precondition for the function to operate correctly.
- **Output**: The result of the dot product is stored in the location pointed to by `s`.

### ggml\_vec\_dot\_iq4\_xs\_q8\_K<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_vec_dot_iq4_xs_q8_K}} -->
Computes the dot product of two quantized vectors and stores the result.
- **Description**: This function calculates the dot product of two vectors that are quantized in specific formats and stores the result in a provided float pointer. It is designed to work with vectors of a length that is a multiple of a constant QK_K, and it is expected that the function is called with nrc set to 1. The function does not handle invalid input values for nrc or n, and it assumes that the input vectors are properly formatted and aligned according to the quantization scheme. The function is intended for use in environments where performance is critical, such as in machine learning or signal processing applications.
- **Inputs**:
    - `n`: The number of elements in the vectors to be processed. Must be a multiple of QK_K.
    - `s`: A pointer to a float where the result of the dot product will be stored. Must not be null.
    - `bs`: A size_t value representing the block size for the output vector. This parameter is unused in the function.
    - `vx`: A pointer to the first input vector, which is expected to be in a specific quantized format. Must not be null.
    - `bx`: A size_t value representing the block size for the first input vector. This parameter is unused in the function.
    - `vy`: A pointer to the second input vector, which is expected to be in a specific quantized format. Must not be null.
    - `by`: A size_t value representing the block size for the second input vector. This parameter is unused in the function.
    - `nrc`: An integer that must be set to 1. The function asserts this condition and does not handle other values.
- **Output**: The result of the dot product is stored in the float pointed to by s.

### ggml\_vec\_dot\_iq3\_s\_q8\_K<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_vec_dot_iq3_s_q8_K}} -->
Computes the dot product of two quantized vectors and stores the result.
- **Description**: This function calculates the dot product of two quantized vectors, `vx` and `vy`, and stores the result in the location pointed to by `s`. It is designed to work with vectors that are quantized in a specific format, and the length of the vectors, `n`, must be a multiple of a predefined constant `QK_K`. The function assumes that `nrc` is always 1, and it does not utilize the `bs`, `bx`, and `by` parameters, which are marked as unused. This function should be used when working with quantized data in the specified format, ensuring that the preconditions on `n` and `nrc` are met.
- **Inputs**:
    - `n`: The number of elements in the vectors to be processed. Must be a multiple of a predefined constant `QK_K`.
    - `s`: A pointer to a float where the result of the dot product will be stored. Must not be null.
    - `bs`: A size_t parameter that is not used in this function.
    - `vx`: A pointer to the first quantized vector. Must not be null and should point to data in the expected format.
    - `bx`: A size_t parameter that is not used in this function.
    - `vy`: A pointer to the second quantized vector. Must not be null and should point to data in the expected format.
    - `by`: A size_t parameter that is not used in this function.
    - `nrc`: An integer that must be set to 1. Other values are not supported.
- **Output**: The result of the dot product is stored in the float pointed to by `s`. The function does not return a value.
