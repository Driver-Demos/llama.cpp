# Purpose
This code is a C++ header file, as indicated by the `#ifndef`, `#define`, and `#endif` preprocessor directives, which are used to prevent multiple inclusions of the same header. It provides a narrow functionality by declaring a single function, `ggml_sycl_op_timestep_embedding`, which is intended to be used in conjunction with SYCL, a parallel computing framework. The function takes a reference to a `ggml_backend_sycl_context` and a pointer to a `ggml_tensor`, suggesting its role in performing operations related to timestep embedding within a SYCL context. The inclusion of `"common.hpp"` implies that this header relies on common definitions or utilities shared across multiple components. This file is part of a larger project, likely related to the LLVM Project, as indicated by the licensing comments, and is intended to be imported and used in other C++ source files.
