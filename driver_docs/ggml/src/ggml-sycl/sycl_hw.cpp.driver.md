# Purpose
This C++ code provides a narrow functionality focused on retrieving hardware information from a SYCL device. It is part of a library or module, as indicated by the inclusion of a header file "sycl_hw.hpp" and the absence of a `main` function, suggesting it is intended to be imported and used elsewhere. The function [`get_device_hw_info`](#get_device_hw_info) takes a pointer to a `sycl::device` object and extracts specific hardware details, such as the device ID and architecture, storing them in a `sycl_hw_info` structure. This function leverages SYCL's extension capabilities to access Intel-specific device information, indicating its use in environments where SYCL is employed for heterogeneous computing.
# Imports and Dependencies

# Functions

### get\_device\_hw\_info<!-- {{#callable:get_device_hw_info}} -->
The function `get_device_hw_info` retrieves hardware information from a SYCL device and returns it as a `sycl_hw_info` structure.
- **Inputs**:
    - `device_ptr`: A pointer to a `sycl::device` object from which hardware information is to be retrieved.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a `sycl_hw_info` structure named `res` to store the hardware information.
    - Retrieve the device ID from the `device_ptr` using `get_info` with `sycl::ext::intel::info::device::device_id` and store it in `res.device_id`.
    - Retrieve the device architecture from the `device_ptr` using `get_info` with `syclex::info::device::architecture` and store it in `res.arch`.
    - Return the `res` structure containing the device hardware information.
- **Output**: A `sycl_hw_info` structure containing the device ID and architecture information of the specified SYCL device.
