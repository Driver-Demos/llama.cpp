# Purpose
The provided C++ source code is part of a larger project that integrates with the SYCL (Standard C++ for Heterogeneous Computing) framework to perform various operations on SYCL-enabled devices, such as GPUs. This file is specifically designed to handle operations related to the GGML (General Graph Machine Learning) library, which is used for machine learning tasks. The code includes functions for initializing SYCL devices, managing memory buffers, and executing various mathematical operations on tensors, such as matrix multiplication, pooling, and normalization.

The file is structured to support both single and multi-device configurations, allowing for operations to be distributed across multiple SYCL devices if available. It defines several key components, including device initialization, memory management, and the execution of specific operations like matrix multiplication and pooling. The code also includes mechanisms for handling errors and exceptions, ensuring robust execution across different hardware configurations. Additionally, it provides interfaces for integrating with the GGML backend, allowing for seamless execution of machine learning tasks on SYCL-enabled devices.
