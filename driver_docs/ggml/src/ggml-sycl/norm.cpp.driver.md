# Purpose
This C++ source code file is designed to perform various normalization operations on floating-point data using SYCL, a parallel programming model for heterogeneous computing. The file includes several static functions that implement different types of normalization, such as standard normalization ([`norm_f32`](#norm_f32)), group normalization ([`group_norm_f32`](#group_norm_f32)), root mean square normalization ([`rms_norm_f32`](#rms_norm_f32)), and L2 normalization ([`l2_norm_f32`](#l2_norm_f32)). These functions are optimized for execution on SYCL-enabled devices, leveraging parallel computing capabilities to efficiently process large datasets. The code uses SYCL's `nd_item<3>` to manage work-items in a 3D space, allowing for fine-grained control over parallel execution.

The file also defines public API functions like [`ggml_sycl_op_norm`](#ggml_sycl_op_norm), [`ggml_sycl_op_group_norm`](#ggml_sycl_op_group_norm), [`ggml_sycl_op_rms_norm`](#ggml_sycl_op_rms_norm), and [`ggml_sycl_op_l2_norm`](#ggml_sycl_op_l2_norm), which serve as interfaces for performing the respective normalization operations on tensors. These functions are part of a broader library or framework, as indicated by the use of `ggml` prefixes, and they interact with a SYCL context to manage device execution. The code is structured to handle different work group sizes and includes assertions to ensure compatibility with the hardware's capabilities. Overall, this file provides specialized functionality for tensor normalization in a high-performance computing context, making it suitable for applications in machine learning and data processing.
