# Purpose
This code is a C++ header file, indicated by the `#ifndef`, `#define`, and `#endif` preprocessor directives, which are used to prevent multiple inclusions of the same header. It provides a narrow functionality focused on defining function prototypes for various normalization operations (`norm`, `rms_norm`, `group_norm`, and `l2_norm`) that are likely implemented elsewhere. These functions are designed to work with a SYCL backend, as suggested by the `ggml_backend_sycl_context` parameter, which implies that they are intended for use in a parallel computing environment. The inclusion of `"common.hpp"` suggests that this header relies on common definitions or utilities shared across multiple components. The file is part of a larger project, possibly related to machine learning or numerical computing, given the context of normalization operations and the association with the LLVM Project.
