# Purpose
This code is a C++ header file, as indicated by the use of include guards (`#ifndef`, `#define`, `#endif`) and the `.hpp` extension, which is typically used for C++ headers. The file provides a narrow functionality focused on operations related to copying and duplicating tensor data within a SYCL backend context, as suggested by the function declarations `ggml_sycl_cpy` and `ggml_sycl_dup`. These functions are likely intended to be implemented elsewhere and used in conjunction with SYCL, a parallel computing framework, to manage tensor data efficiently. The typedef `cpy_kernel_t` defines a function pointer type for a kernel function that performs a copy operation, indicating that this header is part of a larger system dealing with low-level data manipulation in a parallel computing environment.
