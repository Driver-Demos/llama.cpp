# Purpose
This code is a C++ header file, as indicated by the use of include guards (`#ifndef`, `#define`, `#endif`) and the `.hpp` extension, which is typically used for header files. It provides narrow functionality related to querying hardware information for SYCL devices, a parallel programming model for heterogeneous computing. The header file declares a `sycl_hw_info` struct to store hardware architecture and device ID, and it includes function declarations for `is_in_vector`, which checks if an integer is present in a vector, and `get_device_hw_info`, which retrieves hardware information for a given SYCL device. The inclusion of SYCL and OneAPI experimental extensions suggests that this header is intended for use in applications that leverage SYCL for parallel computing tasks.

# Data Structures

---
### sycl\_hw\_info<!-- {{#data_structure:sycl_hw_info}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `arch`: Represents the architecture of the SYCL hardware device.
    - `device_id`: Stores the identifier for the SYCL hardware device.
- **Description**: The `sycl_hw_info` struct is designed to encapsulate information about a SYCL hardware device, specifically its architecture and device identifier. This structure is useful for managing and accessing hardware-specific details in SYCL-based applications, allowing developers to query and utilize device properties effectively.
