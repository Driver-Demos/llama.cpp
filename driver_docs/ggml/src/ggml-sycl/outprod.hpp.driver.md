# Purpose
This code is a C++ header file that provides a narrow and specific functionality related to SYCL, a parallel programming model. It defines a function prototype for `ggml_sycl_op_out_prod`, which is intended to be used elsewhere in a larger codebase. The function takes a reference to a `ggml_backend_sycl_context` and a pointer to a `ggml_tensor`, suggesting it performs an operation related to tensor processing, likely an outer product computation, within a SYCL context. The inclusion guard (`#ifndef`, `#define`, `#endif`) ensures that the header file is only included once during compilation, preventing redefinition errors. This header file is meant to be included in other C++ source files that require the declaration of this specific SYCL operation.
