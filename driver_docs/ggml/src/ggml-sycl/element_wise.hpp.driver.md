# Purpose
The provided C++ header file, `ggml_sycl_elementwise.hpp`, defines a collection of functions intended for performing element-wise operations on tensors using the SYCL backend. This file is part of a broader library or framework that likely deals with tensor computations, as indicated by the inclusion of `ggml.h` and the use of `ggml_tensor` and `ggml_backend_sycl_context` types. The file provides a broad range of mathematical operations, such as square root, trigonometric functions (sine and cosine), activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid, tanh, etc.), and other transformations (exponential, logarithm, negation, etc.) that are commonly used in numerical computing and machine learning applications.

The header file is structured to facilitate the integration of SYCL, a parallel computing standard, to accelerate these operations on compatible hardware. Each function takes a `ggml_backend_sycl_context` and a `ggml_tensor` as parameters, suggesting that these operations are designed to be executed in a parallelized manner on devices supported by SYCL, such as GPUs. The file also includes template functions and structures, such as [`neg_infinity`](#neg_infinity) and `typed_data`, which provide utility for handling data types and casting operations. This header file does not define a public API directly but rather serves as an internal component of a larger system, providing essential functionality for tensor manipulation and computation.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `common.hpp`
- `ggml.h`
- `limits.h`


# Data Structures

---
### typed\_data<!-- {{#data_structure:typed_data}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `src`: A pointer to a constant source of type T.
    - `dst`: A pointer to a destination of type T.
- **Description**: The `typed_data` struct is a template-based data structure designed to hold pointers to source and destination data of a specified type T. It is used to facilitate operations where data needs to be transferred or transformed from a source to a destination, ensuring type safety and consistency in handling data of various types.


# Functions

---
### neg\_infinity<!-- {{#callable:neg_infinity}} -->
The `neg_infinity` function template returns the negative infinity value for a given numeric type `T`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `T`: A template parameter representing the numeric type for which the negative infinity value is to be returned.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses the `std::numeric_limits` template to obtain the infinity value for the type `T`.
    - It then negates this infinity value to return negative infinity.
- **Output**: The function returns the negative infinity value of the specified numeric type `T`.


---
### cast\_data<!-- {{#callable:cast_data}} -->
The `cast_data` function casts the source and destination data pointers of a `ggml_tensor` to a specified type and returns them in a `typed_data` structure.
- **Inputs**:
    - `dst`: A pointer to a `ggml_tensor` object, which contains the source and destination data pointers to be cast.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes a `ggml_tensor` pointer as input.
    - It casts the first source data pointer (`dst->src[0]->data`) to a constant pointer of type `T`.
    - It casts the destination data pointer (`dst->data`) to a pointer of type `T`.
    - It returns a `typed_data` structure containing the cast source and destination pointers.
- **Output**: A `typed_data<T>` structure containing the cast source and destination data pointers.
