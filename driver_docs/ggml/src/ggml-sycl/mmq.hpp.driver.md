# Purpose
This code is a C++ header file that provides a narrow, specialized functionality for matrix multiplication using SYCL, a parallel computing framework. The function `ggml_sycl_op_mul_mat_q` is declared here, which is intended to perform matrix multiplication on tensors within a SYCL context, likely for high-performance computing applications. The function takes several parameters, including tensor pointers and data descriptors, indicating its role in handling complex data structures and operations. The inclusion of `common.hpp` suggests that this header relies on shared definitions or utilities, and the use of SYCL indicates that it is designed for execution on heterogeneous platforms, such as CPUs, GPUs, or other accelerators. The presence of licensing information at the top indicates compliance with open-source licensing requirements, making it suitable for integration into larger projects that adhere to these licenses.
