# Purpose
The provided code is a C++ header file, indicated by the `#ifndef`, `#define`, and `#endif` preprocessor directives, which are used to prevent multiple inclusions of the same header. This file defines function pointer types and declares functions related to data type conversion using SYCL, a parallel computing framework. The functionality is relatively narrow, focusing specifically on converting data to 16-bit and 32-bit floating-point formats, both in contiguous and non-contiguous memory layouts, using SYCL queues for execution. The header is likely intended to be included in other C++ source files that require these specific conversion operations, particularly in environments leveraging SYCL for parallel processing, such as those involving GPU computations.
