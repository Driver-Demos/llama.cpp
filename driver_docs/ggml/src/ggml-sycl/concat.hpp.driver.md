# Purpose
This code is a C++ header file that provides a narrow functionality, specifically for a function declaration intended to be used in a larger system. The function `ggml_sycl_op_concat` is declared to perform an operation related to concatenating tensors, likely within a SYCL (a C++-based parallel programming model) context, as indicated by the use of `ggml_backend_sycl_context` and `ggml_tensor`. The header guards (`#ifndef`, `#define`, `#endif`) prevent multiple inclusions of this file, ensuring that the function declaration is only processed once during compilation. This file is part of a larger project, possibly related to the LLVM project, as suggested by the licensing comments, and is intended to be included in other C++ source files that require this specific tensor concatenation functionality.
