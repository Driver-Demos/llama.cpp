# Purpose
This C++ source code file is designed to perform matrix-vector multiplication using various quantization techniques, optimized for execution on SYCL-enabled devices. The file includes a series of template functions that define different methods for multiplying matrices and vectors, each tailored to specific quantization types such as Q4, Q5, Q8, and others. These functions leverage SYCL's parallel computing capabilities to efficiently perform operations on large datasets, utilizing features like sub-groups and workgroups to distribute the computation across available hardware resources.

The file is structured around a set of static functions, each implementing a specific multiplication strategy for a given quantization type. These functions are invoked within a larger function, [`ggml_sycl_op_mul_mat_vec_q`](#ggml_sycl_op_mul_mat_vec_q), which acts as a dispatcher, selecting the appropriate multiplication function based on the quantization type of the input data. The code is highly modular, with each function focusing on a specific aspect of the matrix-vector multiplication process, such as reordering data or handling different quantization schemes. The use of SYCL's parallel execution model is a key technical component, allowing the code to take advantage of modern GPU architectures for improved performance. This file is part of a larger library or application that deals with quantized data processing, providing a public API for performing these operations in a high-performance computing environment.

### mul\_mat\_vec\_q\_reorder<!-- {{#callable:mul_mat_vec_q_reorder}} -->
The `mul_mat_vec_q_reorder` function performs a matrix-vector multiplication with quantized data, utilizing SYCL for parallel computation and reordering the vector elements for optimized processing.
- **Inputs**:
    - `vx`: A pointer to the input matrix data, expected to be in a quantized format.
    - `vy`: A pointer to the input vector data, also in a quantized format.
    - `dst`: A pointer to the output array where the result of the matrix-vector multiplication will be stored.
    - `ncols`: The number of columns in the input matrix.
    - `nrows`: The number of rows in the input matrix.
    - `nd_item`: A SYCL nd_item object that provides information about the execution context, such as workgroup and subgroup details.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by defining types and traits for the quantized blocks using the [`reorder_vec_dot_q_sycl`](vecdotq.hpp.driver.md#reorder_vec_dot_q_sycl) template parameter.
    - It retrieves the subgroup and workgroup information from the `nd_item` to determine the current row being processed.
    - If the current row exceeds the number of rows (`nrows`), the function returns early.
    - The function calculates the number of blocks per row and other subgroup-related constants for processing the quantized data.
    - A loop iterates over the blocks of the current row, calculating offsets and accessing quantized data pointers for both the matrix and vector.
    - Within the loop, another loop iterates over elements of the subgroup, performing a dot product operation using the [`reorder_vec_dot_q_sycl`](vecdotq.hpp.driver.md#reorder_vec_dot_q_sycl) functor and accumulating the result in `partial_sum`.
    - The partial sums are reduced across the subgroup using `sycl::reduce_over_group`.
    - If the current subgroup leader is active, the final sum is stored in the `dst` array at the position corresponding to the current row.
- **Output**: The function outputs the result of the matrix-vector multiplication into the `dst` array, with each element representing the dot product of a matrix row and the input vector.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`ceil_div`](common.hpp.driver.md#ceil_div)

### ggml\_sycl\_op\_mul\_mat\_vec\_q<!-- {{#callable:ggml_sycl_op_mul_mat_vec_q}} -->
The function `ggml_sycl_op_mul_mat_vec_q` performs a matrix-vector multiplication using SYCL, supporting various quantization types for the input matrix.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A reference to the SYCL backend context used for managing SYCL operations.
    - `src0`: A pointer to the source tensor representing the matrix to be multiplied.
    - `src1`: A pointer to the source tensor representing the vector to be multiplied.
    - `dst`: A pointer to the destination tensor where the result of the multiplication will be stored.
    - `src0_dd_i`: A pointer to the data of the source matrix in a specific format.
    - `src1_ddf_i`: A pointer to the data of the source vector in float format.
    - `src1_ddq_i`: A pointer to the data of the source vector in a quantized format.
    - `dst_dd_i`: A pointer to the data of the destination tensor where the result will be stored.
    - `row_low`: The starting row index for the operation.
    - `row_high`: The ending row index for the operation.
    - `src1_ncols`: The number of columns in the source vector.
    - `src1_padded_col_size`: The padded column size of the source vector.
    - `stream`: A pointer to the SYCL queue used for executing the operations.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by asserting that the number of elements in the first dimension of `src1` is divisible by `QK8_1`.
    - It calculates the number of elements in the first dimension of `src0` and the difference between `row_high` and `row_low`.
    - The current device ID is retrieved and checked for errors.
    - A loop iterates over each column in `src1`, calculating offsets for the quantized data pointers.
    - Based on the type of `src0`, the function selects the appropriate SYCL kernel function to perform the matrix-vector multiplication, with special handling for reordered data.
    - Unused parameters are marked with `GGML_UNUSED` to avoid compiler warnings.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it writes the result of the matrix-vector multiplication into the `dst` tensor.
