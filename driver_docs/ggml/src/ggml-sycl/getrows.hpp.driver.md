# Purpose
This code is a C++ header file, indicated by the `.hpp` extension, and it provides a narrow functionality specific to a SYCL operation within the GGML (General Graph Machine Learning) framework. The file defines a function prototype `ggml_sycl_op_get_rows`, which is intended to be implemented elsewhere, and it takes a SYCL context and a tensor pointer as parameters. The purpose of this function is likely to perform an operation related to retrieving or processing rows of a tensor in a SYCL-enabled environment, which is a parallel computing framework. The header file is designed to be included in other C++ source files, as suggested by the include guard `#ifndef GGML_SYCL_GETROWS_HPP`, which prevents multiple inclusions and potential redefinition errors.
