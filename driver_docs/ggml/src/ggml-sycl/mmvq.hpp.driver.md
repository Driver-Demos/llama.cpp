# Purpose
This code is a C++ header file that provides a narrow functionality, specifically defining a function prototype for a matrix-vector multiplication operation using SYCL, a parallel computing framework. The function `ggml_sycl_op_mul_mat_vec_q` is designed to perform operations on tensors, which are multi-dimensional arrays, within a SYCL context, indicating its use in high-performance computing or machine learning applications. The function takes several parameters, including tensor pointers and data pointers, as well as parameters defining the range of rows and column sizes, suggesting its role in handling large-scale data processing tasks. The inclusion of a header guard (`#ifndef GGML_SYCL_MMVQ_HPP`) ensures that the file's contents are only included once during compilation, preventing redefinition errors. This header file is intended to be included in other C++ source files that require this specific matrix-vector multiplication functionality.
