# Purpose
This code is a C++ header file that provides a narrow and specific functionality related to the SYCL backend of a machine learning library, likely part of the LLVM project. It declares a single function, `ggml_sycl_op_soft_max`, which is intended to perform a softmax operation on a tensor using a SYCL context, as indicated by the parameters `ggml_backend_sycl_context &ctx` and `ggml_tensor *dst`. The file is designed to be included in other C++ source files, as suggested by the inclusion guards (`#ifndef GGML_SYCL_SOFTMAX_HPP` and `#define GGML_SYCL_SOFTMAX_HPP`), which prevent multiple inclusions. The presence of licensing information at the top indicates compliance with open-source licensing requirements, specifically the MIT and Apache licenses.
