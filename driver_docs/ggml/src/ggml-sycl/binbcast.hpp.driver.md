# Purpose
This code is a C++ header file, as indicated by the `#ifndef`, `#define`, and `#endif` preprocessor directives, which are used to prevent multiple inclusions of the file. It provides a narrow set of functionalities related to basic arithmetic operations and their application in a SYCL (a C++-based parallel programming model) context. The file defines inline functions for basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and a repeat operation) on floating-point numbers. Additionally, it declares functions that likely perform these operations on tensors within a SYCL backend context, suggesting its use in a parallel computing or machine learning framework. The inclusion of `"common.hpp"` implies dependency on shared definitions or utilities, and the use of `GGML_UNUSED` suggests a macro to suppress unused variable warnings.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `common.hpp`


# Functions

---
### op\_repeat<!-- {{#callable:op_repeat}} -->
The `op_repeat` function returns the second input argument, effectively ignoring the first input.
- **Inputs**:
    - `a`: A float value that is ignored in the function.
    - `b`: A float value that is returned by the function.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes two float arguments, `a` and `b`.
    - The function returns the value of `b`.
    - The macro `GGML_UNUSED(a);` is used to explicitly mark `a` as unused to avoid compiler warnings.
- **Output**: The function returns the float value of the second argument `b`.


---
### op\_add<!-- {{#callable:op_add}} -->
The `op_add` function performs addition on two floating-point numbers and returns the result.
- **Inputs**:
    - `a`: The first floating-point number to be added.
    - `b`: The second floating-point number to be added.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes two floating-point numbers as input parameters.
    - It computes the sum of the two input numbers.
    - The result of the addition is returned.
- **Output**: The function returns the sum of the two input floating-point numbers as a float.


---
### op\_sub<!-- {{#callable:op_sub}} -->
The `op_sub` function performs subtraction between two floating-point numbers.
- **Inputs**:
    - `a`: The first floating-point number to be subtracted from.
    - `b`: The second floating-point number to subtract.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes two float arguments, `a` and `b`.
    - It calculates the result of `a - b`.
    - The result is returned as a float.
- **Output**: The function returns the result of the subtraction as a float.


---
### op\_mul<!-- {{#callable:op_mul}} -->
The `op_mul` function performs multiplication of two floating-point numbers and returns the result.
- **Inputs**:
    - `a`: The first floating-point number to be multiplied.
    - `b`: The second floating-point number to be multiplied.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes two floating-point numbers as input parameters.
    - It multiplies the two input numbers together.
- **Output**: The result of multiplying the two input floating-point numbers.


---
### op\_div<!-- {{#callable:op_div}} -->
The `op_div` function performs division of two floating-point numbers.
- **Inputs**:
    - `a`: The dividend, a floating-point number.
    - `b`: The divisor, a floating-point number.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes two floating-point numbers as input parameters.
    - It returns the result of dividing the first number (a) by the second number (b).
- **Output**: A floating-point number representing the result of the division of `a` by `b`.
