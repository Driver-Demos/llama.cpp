# Purpose
This code is a C++ header file that provides narrow functionality, specifically for a SYCL-based operation related to gated linear attention. It defines a function prototype, `ggml_sycl_op_gated_linear_attn`, which takes a reference to a `ggml_backend_sycl_context` and a pointer to a `ggml_tensor` as parameters. The function is likely intended to be implemented elsewhere, and this header file allows other parts of a program to use this function by including it. The inclusion guards (`#ifndef`, `#define`, and `#endif`) prevent multiple inclusions of the header file, ensuring that the function declaration is only processed once during compilation. This file is part of a larger library or application that deals with SYCL and tensor operations, as suggested by the inclusion of "common.hpp" and the naming conventions used.
