# Purpose
This C++ source code file defines a function [`ggml_sycl_op_out_prod`](#ggml_sycl_op_out_prod) that performs an outer product operation using SYCL (a C++-based parallel programming model) and oneAPI's math library. The function is designed to be part of a larger system that handles tensor operations, as indicated by the use of `ggml_tensor` structures and the `ggml_backend_sycl_context` for managing SYCL execution contexts. The function ensures that the input tensors (`src0` and `src1`) and the destination tensor (`dst`) are of type `GGML_TYPE_F32` and are contiguous in memory, which is crucial for efficient computation. It also performs necessary dimension checks to ensure the inner dimensions of the input tensors match, which is a prerequisite for matrix multiplication.

The core functionality of this code is to execute a matrix multiplication operation using the oneAPI's BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) library, specifically the `gemm` function, which is optimized for column-major order matrices. The function handles potential transposition of the second source tensor (`src1`) and sets up the necessary parameters for the `gemm` operation, such as the alpha and beta coefficients. The use of SYCL and oneAPI indicates that this code is intended for high-performance computing environments, potentially leveraging GPU or other accelerators. The function is part of a broader library or application that deals with tensor computations, and it does not define a public API or external interface directly, but rather contributes to the internal implementation of tensor operations.

### ggml\_sycl\_op\_out\_prod<!-- {{#callable:ggml_sycl_op_out_prod}} -->
The `ggml_sycl_op_out_prod` function performs a matrix multiplication operation on two input tensors using SYCL and stores the result in a destination tensor.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A reference to a `ggml_backend_sycl_context` object, which provides the SYCL queue for executing operations.
    - `dst`: A pointer to a `ggml_tensor` object that serves as the destination tensor for the output of the matrix multiplication.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a debug print scope for the operation.
    - Retrieve the source tensors `src0` and `src1` from the `dst` tensor's source array.
    - Assert that the data types of `src0`, `src1`, and `dst` are all `GGML_TYPE_F32`.
    - Assert that `src0` and `dst` are contiguous in memory.
    - Retrieve the SYCL queue from the context `ctx`.
    - Perform dimension checks to ensure compatibility for matrix multiplication.
    - Retrieve data pointers for `src0`, `src1`, and `dst`.
    - Set the GEMM parameters `alpha` and `beta`.
    - Determine if `src1` is transposed and set the appropriate transpose operation for the GEMM call.
    - Calculate the leading dimension `ldb` for `src1` based on its transposition state.
    - Attempt to perform the matrix multiplication using the oneMath GEMM function, catching any SYCL exceptions and asserting false if an exception occurs.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `dst` tensor in place to store the result of the matrix multiplication.
