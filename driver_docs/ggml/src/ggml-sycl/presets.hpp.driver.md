# Purpose
This code is a C++ header file that defines a set of preprocessor macros for configuring SYCL (a C++-based parallel programming model) operations, specifically for use with the GGML library, which is likely related to machine learning or numerical computations. The file provides narrow functionality, focusing on setting constants and parameters such as maximum streams, buffer sizes, and block sizes for various operations like GELU, ReLU, and matrix operations, which are crucial for optimizing performance on SYCL-enabled hardware. It includes conditional compilation directives to ensure that certain parameters are defined, and it uses static assertions to enforce constraints on specific values, ensuring that the code adheres to expected configurations. This header file is intended to be included in other C++ source files to provide these preset configurations, facilitating consistent and optimized execution of SYCL-based tasks across different parts of a project.
