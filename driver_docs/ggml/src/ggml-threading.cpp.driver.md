# Purpose
This C++ code provides narrow functionality focused on thread synchronization by managing access to a critical section using a mutex. It is likely part of a larger library or module, as it includes a header file "ggml-threading.h" and defines functions that are intended to be used elsewhere. The code defines a global `std::mutex` named `ggml_critical_section_mutex` and two functions, `ggml_critical_section_start()` and `ggml_critical_section_end()`, which lock and unlock the mutex, respectively. This setup ensures that only one thread can execute the code within the critical section at a time, preventing race conditions and ensuring thread safety in concurrent environments.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `ggml-threading.h`
- `mutex`


# Global Variables

---
### ggml\_critical\_section\_mutex
- **Type**: `std::mutex`
- **Description**: The `ggml_critical_section_mutex` is a global mutex object used to manage access to critical sections of code, ensuring that only one thread can execute a particular section at a time. This is crucial in multi-threaded environments to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency.
- **Use**: This mutex is used to lock and unlock critical sections in the `ggml_critical_section_start` and `ggml_critical_section_end` functions, respectively.


# Functions

---
### ggml\_critical\_section\_start<!-- {{#callable:ggml_critical_section_start}} -->
The function `ggml_critical_section_start` locks a mutex to begin a critical section, ensuring exclusive access to shared resources.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls the `lock` method on the `ggml_critical_section_mutex` object.
    - This action blocks the calling thread until it can obtain a lock on the mutex, ensuring no other thread can enter the critical section until the lock is released.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value.


---
### ggml\_critical\_section\_end<!-- {{#callable:ggml_critical_section_end}} -->
The function `ggml_critical_section_end` unlocks a mutex to end a critical section in a multithreaded environment.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls the `unlock` method on the `ggml_critical_section_mutex` to release the lock.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value.
