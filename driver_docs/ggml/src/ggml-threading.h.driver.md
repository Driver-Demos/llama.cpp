# Purpose
This code is a C header file that provides an interface for managing critical sections in a program using the GGML library. It includes function declarations for [`ggml_critical_section_start`](#ggml_critical_section_start) and [`ggml_critical_section_end`](#ggml_critical_section_end), which are likely used to mark the beginning and end of critical sections, ensuring thread safety by preventing concurrent access to shared resources. The `#pragma once` directive is used to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file, and the `extern "C"` block ensures compatibility with C++ compilers by preventing name mangling. The `GGML_API` macro is typically used to handle cross-platform symbol visibility, indicating that these functions are part of the library's public API.

# Function Declarations (Public API)

### ggml\_critical\_section\_start<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_critical_section_start}} -->
Enter a critical section to ensure thread safety.
- **Description**: Use this function to enter a critical section, which is necessary when performing operations that must not be interrupted by other threads. It should be paired with a call to `ggml_critical_section_end` to exit the critical section. This function is typically used in multi-threaded environments to protect shared resources from concurrent access, ensuring data integrity and preventing race conditions. Ensure that every call to this function is matched with a corresponding call to `ggml_critical_section_end` to avoid deadlocks.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`ggml_critical_section_start`](ggml-threading.cpp.driver.md#ggml_critical_section_start)  (Implementation)

### ggml\_critical\_section\_end<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_critical_section_end}} -->
Ends a critical section in a multithreaded environment.
- **Description**: This function should be called to signal the end of a critical section that was previously started with a call to `ggml_critical_section_start`. It is used in multithreaded environments to ensure that shared resources are accessed in a thread-safe manner. The function must be called after `ggml_critical_section_start` to properly release the lock acquired at the start of the critical section. Failure to call this function after starting a critical section may lead to deadlocks or resource contention issues.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`ggml_critical_section_end`](ggml-threading.cpp.driver.md#ggml_critical_section_end)  (Implementation)
