# Purpose
This is a CMake configuration script used to set up the build process for a software project. It specifies the inclusion of an RPC backend by adding the `ggml-rpc` library, which is built from the `ggml-rpc.cpp` source file. Additionally, it conditionally links the `ws2_32` library on Windows platforms to support Windows Sockets API functionality.
