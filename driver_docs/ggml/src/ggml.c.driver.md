    - `by`: A size_t parameter that is unused in this function.
    - `nrc`: Must be set to 1. This is a precondition for the function to operate correctly.
- **Output**: The result of the dot product is stored in the location pointed to by `s`. The function does not return a value.

### ggml\_vec\_dot\_f16<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_vec_dot_f16}} -->
Computes the dot product of two half-precision floating-point vectors.
- **Description**: This function calculates the dot product of two vectors, `x` and `y`, both of which are represented in half-precision floating-point format. The result is stored in the location pointed to by `s`, which is a single-precision floating-point variable. The function is designed to handle vectors of length `n`, and it is expected that `nrc` is always set to 1. This function should be used when you need to compute the dot product of vectors stored in half-precision format, and it is important to ensure that the pointers `s`, `x`, and `y` are not null and point to valid memory locations.
- **Inputs**:
    - `n`: The number of elements in the vectors `x` and `y`. Must be a positive integer.
    - `s`: A pointer to a float where the result of the dot product will be stored. Must not be null.
    - `bs`: A size_t value representing the stride for `s`. It is unused in this function.
    - `x`: A pointer to the first half-precision floating-point vector. Must not be null and should point to at least `n` elements.
    - `bx`: A size_t value representing the stride for `x`. It is unused in this function.
    - `y`: A pointer to the second half-precision floating-point vector. Must not be null and should point to at least `n` elements.
    - `by`: A size_t value representing the stride for `y`. It is unused in this function.
    - `nrc`: An integer that must be set to 1. Any other value will cause an assertion failure.
- **Output**: The result of the dot product is stored in the float pointed to by `s`.

### ggml\_vec\_dot\_bf16<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ggml_vec_dot_bf16}} -->
Computes the dot product of two vectors in BF16 format and stores the result in a float.
- **Description**: This function calculates the dot product of two vectors, `x` and `y`, both in BF16 format, and stores the result in the float pointed to by `s`. It is intended for use when working with vectors of BF16 data, and the result is accumulated in single-precision floating point format. The function requires that `nrc` is set to 1, and it is expected that the input vectors are properly aligned and of the same length. The function does not handle invalid input values, so the caller must ensure that all pointers are valid and that `n` is non-negative.
- **Inputs**:
    - `n`: The number of elements in the vectors `x` and `y`. Must be non-negative.
    - `s`: A pointer to a float where the result of the dot product will be stored. Must not be null.
    - `bs`: Unused parameter, should be ignored.
    - `x`: A pointer to the first vector in BF16 format. Must not be null and should point to at least `n` elements.
    - `bx`: Unused parameter, should be ignored.
    - `y`: A pointer to the second vector in BF16 format. Must not be null and should point to at least `n` elements.
    - `by`: Unused parameter, should be ignored.
    - `nrc`: Must be set to 1. Any other value will cause an assertion failure.
- **Output**: The result of the dot product is stored in the float pointed to by `s`. The function does not return a value.
