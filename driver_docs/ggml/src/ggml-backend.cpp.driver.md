# Purpose
This C++ source code file is part of a larger system that manages backend operations for a machine learning framework, specifically focusing on memory management and computation scheduling across different hardware backends. The file defines a comprehensive set of functions and structures to handle backend buffers, devices, and scheduling of computational graphs. It includes functionality for allocating, initializing, and managing memory buffers, as well as for scheduling and executing operations on these buffers across different backends, such as CPU and potentially other accelerators.

The code is organized into several key components: backend buffer management, backend device management, and a scheduler for computational graphs. The buffer management section provides functions to allocate, free, and manipulate memory buffers, ensuring proper alignment and handling of different buffer types. The device management section defines interfaces for interacting with different hardware devices, allowing the system to query device properties and capabilities. The scheduler component is responsible for splitting computational graphs into subgraphs that can be executed on different backends, optimizing for performance and resource utilization. This file is likely part of a library that can be imported into other projects, providing a public API for managing backend operations in a flexible and efficient manner.
