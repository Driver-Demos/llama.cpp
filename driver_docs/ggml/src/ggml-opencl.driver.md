## Folders
- **[kernels](ggml-opencl/kernels.driver.md)**: The `kernels` folder in the `llama.cpp` codebase contains a comprehensive collection of OpenCL kernel files and a Python script, which implement various mathematical operations, data transformations, and activation functions optimized for different GPU architectures.

## Files
- **[CMakeLists.txt](ggml-opencl/CMakeLists.txt.driver.md)**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `llama.cpp/ggml/src/ggml-opencl` directory configures the build process for the `ggml-opencl` target, including finding required packages, setting up OpenCL kernels, and handling optional features like profiling and kernel embedding.
- **[ggml-opencl.cpp](ggml-opencl/ggml-opencl.cpp.driver.md)**: The `ggml-opencl.cpp` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase implements an OpenCL backend for a machine learning library, providing GPU-accelerated tensor operations such as matrix multiplication, element-wise functions, and more complex operations like GELU and normalization, while managing memory, error checking, and kernel compilation for various GPU architectures.
