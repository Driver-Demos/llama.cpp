# Purpose
This code is a compute shader written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) version 450, designed to perform parallel computations on the GPU. The shader is structured to handle matrix or tensor operations, as indicated by the use of buffer objects for input and output data. It reads from two input buffers, `tensorInA` and `tensorInB`, and writes results to an output buffer, `tensorOut`. The shader is configured to execute with a local workgroup size of 4x8x1, which suggests that it is optimized for operations that can be parallelized across these dimensions.

The shader utilizes a set of push constants defined in a uniform block named `parameter`, which provides various offsets and dimensions necessary for indexing into the input and output buffers. These constants are crucial for determining the specific portions of the data to be processed by each invocation of the shader. The main function of the shader involves complex indexing and arithmetic operations, including bitwise manipulations and floating-point calculations, to compute results based on the input data. The use of subgroup operations, such as `subgroupAdd` and `subgroupElect`, indicates that the shader takes advantage of advanced GPU features for efficient parallel reduction and conditional execution within subgroups.

Overall, this shader is a specialized component of a larger graphics or compute pipeline, likely used for high-performance numerical computations such as those found in machine learning, scientific simulations, or real-time graphics applications. Its design leverages the parallel processing capabilities of modern GPUs to perform intensive calculations on large datasets efficiently.
# Global Variables

### N\_DST
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: `N_DST` is a preprocessor macro defined as an integer with a value of 4. It represents the number of destination rows processed in a single iteration of the main computation loop in the shader program.
- **Use**: `N_DST` is used to determine the number of rows to process in parallel within the compute shader, affecting loop iterations and memory access patterns.

### SIZE\_OF\_BLOCK
- **Type**: `macro`
- **Description**: `SIZE_OF_BLOCK` is a macro defined as `sizeof_block_q4_k`. It represents the size of a block in the context of the shader program, likely related to the data structure `block_q4_k`. This macro is used to calculate offsets and indices for accessing elements in the buffer, ensuring that operations are performed on correctly sized data blocks.
- **Use**: `SIZE_OF_BLOCK` is used to calculate offsets for accessing elements in the buffer, ensuring correct alignment and data block size handling.


# Functions

### main
The `main` function performs a parallel computation on input tensors using a GPU shader, applying a series of transformations and reductions to produce an output tensor.
- **Inputs**:
    - `tensorInA`: A read-only buffer containing an array of `block_q4_k` structures, representing the first input tensor.
    - `tensorInB`: A read-only buffer containing an array of floats, representing the second input tensor.
    - `tensorOut`: A write-only buffer where the computed output tensor will be stored.
    - `pcs`: A uniform parameter block containing various constants and offsets used in the computation, such as offsets for input and output tensors, dimensions, and block sizes.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize constants and indices for subgroup and workgroup operations.
    - Calculate offsets and indices for accessing input tensors based on workgroup and subgroup IDs.
    - Iterate over blocks of the input tensor `inA`, performing computations in parallel across subgroups.
    - For each block, compute intermediate sums using elements from `inB` and scales from `inA`.
    - Apply scaling and reduction operations to compute final sums for each row of the output tensor.
    - Use subgroup operations to aggregate results and write the final computed values to the output buffer.
- **Output**: The function writes the computed results to the `tensorOut` buffer, which contains the transformed and reduced output tensor.
