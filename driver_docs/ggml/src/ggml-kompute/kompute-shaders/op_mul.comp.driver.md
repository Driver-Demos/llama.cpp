# Purpose
This code is a GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) compute shader designed to perform parallel computations on the GPU. The shader is intended for high-performance operations on large datasets, specifically for element-wise multiplication of two input tensors, `inA` and `inB`, and storing the result in an output tensor, `out_`. The shader uses a local workgroup size of 1024, indicating that each workgroup can handle up to 1024 parallel invocations, which is suitable for processing large arrays efficiently.

The shader defines three buffer objects: `tensorInA`, `tensorInB`, and `tensorOut`, which are bound to specific binding points and are used to read from and write to GPU memory. The `PushConstants` structure is used to pass various parameters to the shader, such as offsets and dimensions of the input and output tensors. These constants allow the shader to be flexible and adaptable to different tensor sizes and configurations without recompiling the shader code.

The `main` function is the entry point of the shader, where the actual computation takes place. It calculates offsets for accessing the input and output buffers based on the workgroup and local invocation IDs. The shader iterates over the elements of the input tensors, performs the multiplication, and writes the result to the output buffer. This approach leverages the parallel processing capabilities of the GPU to efficiently handle large-scale tensor operations, making it suitable for applications in scientific computing, machine learning, and graphics processing.

- **Description**: The `PushConstants` data structure is a uniform block used in a shader program to store various offsets and dimension sizes for input and output buffers. It includes unsigned integers for buffer offsets and integers for dimension sizes, which are used to calculate memory access patterns within the shader. This structure allows for efficient data manipulation and access within the GPU, facilitating operations such as matrix multiplication or other tensor computations.


# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function performs element-wise multiplication of two input tensors and stores the result in an output tensor using GPU parallel processing.
- **Inputs**:
    - `inA`: A buffer containing the first input tensor, accessed as a read-only array of floats.
    - `inB`: A buffer containing the second input tensor, accessed as a read-only array of floats.
    - `out_`: A buffer for the output tensor, accessed as a write-only array of floats.
    - `pcs`: A structure of push constants containing various offsets and dimensions for tensor operations.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the workgroup and local invocation IDs to determine the current execution context within the GPU.
    - Calculate indices `i03`, `i02`, and `i01` from the workgroup IDs to determine the current position in the 3D grid of workgroups.
    - Compute offsets `src0_off`, `src1_off`, and `dst_off` for accessing elements in the input and output buffers based on the push constants and workgroup indices.
    - Iterate over the local invocation ID `i0` to process elements in chunks defined by the local workgroup size.
    - For each element, calculate the index `i10` and perform element-wise multiplication of corresponding elements from `inA` and `inB`, storing the result in `out_`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it writes the results of the tensor multiplication directly to the `out_` buffer.
