# Purpose
This code is a GLSL compute shader designed to perform element-wise addition of two tensors. It is intended to be executed on a GPU, leveraging parallel processing capabilities to efficiently handle large-scale data operations. The shader is written in GLSL version 450 and includes a common component file, "common.comp," which likely contains shared definitions or functions used across multiple shader programs. The shader defines a local workgroup size of 1024, indicating that each workgroup will consist of 1024 threads, which is a common configuration for maximizing GPU utilization.

The shader uses buffer objects to read from two input tensors (`inA` and `inB`) and write to an output tensor (`out_`). These buffers are bound to specific binding points, allowing the shader to access the data stored in them. The use of `restrict` qualifiers suggests that the buffers are accessed in a way that avoids aliasing, which can improve performance by allowing the compiler to make certain optimizations. The shader also utilizes push constants, which are a mechanism for passing small amounts of data to the shader without the overhead of buffer objects. These constants include offsets and dimensions necessary for indexing into the tensors and handling non-contiguous data layouts.

The main function of the shader is a general-purpose kernel that supports addition of non-contiguous tensors and broadcasting across dimensions 1, 2, and 3. The kernel calculates offsets for the input and output tensors based on the workgroup and local invocation IDs, allowing each thread to process a specific portion of the data. While the shader is versatile in handling various tensor shapes and layouts, it is noted in the comments that it may not be the most efficient implementation, likely due to the overhead of handling non-contiguous data and broadcasting. This shader is a specialized component within a larger system, likely part of a machine learning or scientific computing application that requires tensor operations on the GPU.

    - `ne13`: An integer representing a dimension size or extent for tensor B.
    - `nb10`: An integer representing a stride or offset for tensor B.
    - `nb11`: An integer representing a stride or offset for tensor B.
    - `nb12`: An integer representing a stride or offset for tensor B.
    - `nb13`: An integer representing a stride or offset for tensor B.
    - `ne0`: An integer representing a dimension size or extent for the output tensor.
    - `nb0`: An integer representing a stride or offset for the output tensor.
    - `nb1`: An integer representing a stride or offset for the output tensor.
    - `nb2`: An integer representing a stride or offset for the output tensor.
    - `nb3`: An integer representing a stride or offset for the output tensor.
- **Description**: The `PushConstants` data structure is a uniform block used in a shader program to store various offsets and dimension sizes for input and output tensors. It includes unsigned integers for offsets (`inAOff`, `inBOff`, `outOff`) and integers for dimension sizes and strides for both input tensors A and B, as well as the output tensor. These constants are used to calculate memory offsets and manage tensor operations within the shader, facilitating operations like tensor addition with support for non-contiguous tensors and broadcasting across multiple dimensions.


# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function is a general-purpose kernel for adding two tensors, supporting non-contiguous tensors and broadcasting across dimensions 1, 2, and 3.
- **Inputs**:
    - `inA`: A read-only buffer containing the first input tensor.
    - `inB`: A read-only buffer containing the second input tensor.
    - `out_`: A write-only buffer where the result of the tensor addition is stored.
    - `pcs`: A uniform block of push constants containing various offsets and dimensions for tensor operations.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the workgroup IDs for the current invocation to determine the indices for tensor operations.
    - Calculate the offsets for the source tensors (inA and inB) and the destination tensor (out_) using the workgroup IDs and push constants.
    - Iterate over the local invocation ID to process each element in the tensor, adjusting for the workgroup size.
    - Perform element-wise addition of the two input tensors, storing the result in the output buffer.
- **Output**: The function outputs the result of the element-wise addition of two tensors into the `out_` buffer.
