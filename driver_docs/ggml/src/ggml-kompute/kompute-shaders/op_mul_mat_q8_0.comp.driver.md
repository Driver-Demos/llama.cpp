# Purpose
This code is a compute shader written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) version 450, designed to perform parallel matrix-vector multiplication using SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) groups. The shader is structured to work efficiently on GPUs, particularly addressing compatibility with AMD GPUs by handling subgroup sizes. It includes several preprocessor directives to define constants that control the size and behavior of the SIMD groups, such as the number of destination rows (`N_DST`), the number of SIMD groups per thread group (`N_SIMDGROUP`), and the SIMD group width (`N_SIMDWIDTH`). The shader also includes external components through `#include` directives, suggesting modularity and reuse of common functionality.

The main function of the shader is to compute the product of a matrix and a vector, where each thread in a SIMD group processes a portion of the data. The shader uses a combination of global and local workgroup identifiers to determine the specific data each thread will process. It calculates offsets into input arrays `inA` and `inB` to fetch the necessary data for computation. The shader performs quantized operations, as indicated by the use of `int8_t` and `float16_t` types, which are common in performance-critical applications like graphics rendering or machine learning inference on GPUs.

The shader's output is written to a buffer `out_`, where each thread contributes to the final result using operations like `subgroupAdd` to aggregate results across the SIMD group. The use of `subgroupElect` ensures that only one thread writes the final result for each row, maintaining data integrity. This shader is a specialized component within a larger graphics or compute pipeline, likely part of a library or application that requires efficient matrix computations on the GPU.
# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function performs a matrix-vector multiplication using SIMD groups and writes the result to an output buffer, optimized for compatibility with AMD GPUs.
- **Inputs**:
    - `gl_SubgroupInvocationID`: The ID of the current invocation within the subgroup, used to determine if the function should return early for compatibility with AMD GPUs.
    - `gl_WorkGroupID`: A three-component vector representing the workgroup's ID in the x, y, and z dimensions, used to calculate offsets and indices for processing.
    - `pcs`: A structure containing various parameters such as `ne00`, `ne12`, `ne01`, `ne02`, `ne10`, `ne1`, `inAOff`, and `inBOff`, which are used to calculate offsets and dimensions for input and output data.
    - `inA`: An input buffer containing matrix data, accessed using calculated offsets for matrix-vector multiplication.
    - `inB`: An input buffer containing vector data, accessed using calculated offsets for matrix-vector multiplication.
    - `out_`: An output buffer where the results of the matrix-vector multiplication are stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `gl_SubgroupInvocationID` is greater than 31 and return early if true, to ensure compatibility with AMD GPUs.
    - Calculate constants `nr`, `nsg`, `nw`, and `nb` based on predefined macros and `pcs` structure values.
    - Determine the `first_row` and offsets `offset0`, `x`, and `y` using workgroup IDs and `pcs` parameters.
    - Initialize local arrays `yl` and `sumf` for storing intermediate results.
    - Calculate `ix` and `il` from `gl_SubgroupInvocationID` to determine the starting index and lane within the subgroup.
    - Iterate over blocks of the input vector `inB`, loading data into `yl` and performing matrix-vector multiplication with `inA`.
    - For each row, compute the sum of products `sumq` and scale by a factor `d` converted from `inA`, accumulating results in `sumf`.
    - Use `subgroupAdd` to sum results across the subgroup and conditionally write the final result to the output buffer `out_` if the current invocation is elected and within bounds.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but writes the computed matrix-vector multiplication results to the `out_` buffer.
