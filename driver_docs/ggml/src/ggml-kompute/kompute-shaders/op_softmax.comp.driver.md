# Purpose
This code is a GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) compute shader designed to perform a softmax operation on input tensors using a multi-SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) approach. The shader is intended to be executed on a GPU, leveraging parallel processing capabilities to efficiently compute the softmax function, which is commonly used in machine learning and neural network applications. The shader reads input data from two buffers, `inA` and `inB`, and writes the computed softmax results to an output buffer, `out_`. The use of GLSL indicates that this code is part of a graphics or compute pipeline, likely within a larger application that requires high-performance computation.

The shader utilizes several technical components to achieve its functionality. It defines a set of push constants, which are used to pass configuration parameters such as offsets, dimensions, scaling factors, and other necessary constants to the shader. The main function of the shader is structured to handle parallel computation using workgroups and subgroups, which are constructs in GLSL that allow for efficient data processing across multiple threads. The shader calculates a slope for an ALiBi (Attention Linear Bias) mechanism, which adjusts the computation based on the head index in a multi-head attention model, a common component in transformer architectures.

Overall, this shader is a specialized piece of code that provides a narrow but critical functionality within a larger system, likely related to neural network processing or similar high-performance computing tasks. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly but is intended to be integrated into a larger application where it can be invoked as part of a compute pipeline. The shader's design emphasizes parallelism and efficiency, making it suitable for tasks that require rapid computation of softmax operations on large datasets.

# Functions

### main
The `main` function implements a parallelized softmax operation using GPU shaders with optional ALiBi biasing.
- **Inputs**:
    - `inA`: A buffer containing the input tensor A, read-only.
    - `inB`: A buffer containing the input tensor B, read-only, used for biasing if mask is non-zero.
    - `out_`: A buffer for the output tensor, write-only.
    - `pcs`: A structure of push constants containing various parameters such as offsets, dimensions, scaling factors, and mask.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the current subgroup invocation ID is greater than 31 and return if true, effectively limiting processing to the first 32 invocations.
    - Calculate the extra offset for accessing the input and output buffers based on the workgroup IDs and push constants.
    - Determine the slope for ALiBi biasing based on the head index and push constants if max_bias is greater than zero.
    - Initialize a local maximum value and iterate over the input tensor A in steps of 32, updating the local maximum with scaled and optionally biased values.
    - Compute the maximum value across the subgroup using `subgroupMax`.
    - Initialize a local sum and iterate over the input tensor A in steps of 32, computing the exponentiated and optionally biased values, updating the local sum and storing the results in the output buffer.
    - Compute the sum across the subgroup using `subgroupAdd`.
    - Normalize the output values by dividing each by the computed sum.
- **Output**: The function writes the normalized softmax results to the `out_` buffer.
