# Purpose
This code is a compute shader written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) version 4.50, designed to perform parallel computations on the GPU. It provides narrow functionality, specifically for scaling elements of an input buffer and writing the results to an output buffer. The shader is not an executable on its own but is intended to be part of a larger graphics or compute pipeline, where it can be invoked by a host application to process data in parallel. The use of `layout` qualifiers and `push_constant` indicates that this shader is optimized for efficient data handling and manipulation, leveraging GPU resources for high-performance computing tasks. The inclusion of "common.comp" suggests that it may rely on shared definitions or functions, indicating modularity and reusability within a broader shader program.
# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function performs a scaled copy of input tensor elements to an output tensor using GPU compute shaders.
- **Inputs**:
    - `gl_WorkGroupID.x`: The index of the current workgroup, used to determine which element of the tensors to process.
    - `in_[]`: The input buffer containing the tensor elements to be read.
    - `out_[]`: The output buffer where the scaled tensor elements will be written.
    - `pcs.inOff`: The offset in the input buffer from where to start reading elements.
    - `pcs.outOff`: The offset in the output buffer where to start writing elements.
    - `pcs.scale`: The scaling factor to be applied to each input element before writing to the output buffer.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the current workgroup index `i` using `gl_WorkGroupID.x`.
    - Calculate the output index by adding `pcs.outOff` to `i`.
    - Calculate the input index by adding `pcs.inOff` to `i`.
    - Multiply the input element at the calculated input index by `pcs.scale`.
    - Store the result in the output buffer at the calculated output index.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it writes the scaled input tensor elements to the output buffer.
