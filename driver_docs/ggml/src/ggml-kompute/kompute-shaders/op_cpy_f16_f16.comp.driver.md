# Purpose
This code is a GLSL compute shader designed to perform data transformation or processing on tensor data. It is intended to be executed on a GPU, leveraging parallel processing capabilities to efficiently handle large datasets. The shader is written in GLSL version 450 and includes a common component file, "common.comp," which likely contains shared definitions or functions used across multiple shader programs. The shader defines input and output data types as 16-bit floating-point numbers (float16_t) and specifies the size of the local workgroup as 1024 threads, indicating that it is optimized for high-performance parallel computation.

The shader uses two buffer objects: a read-only buffer for input tensor data and a write-only buffer for output tensor data. These buffers are bound to specific binding points, allowing the shader to access and modify the data during execution. The shader also defines a set of push constants, which are uniform parameters that provide additional configuration for the shader's execution. These parameters include offsets and dimensions for both input and output data, as well as strides for navigating through the tensor data. The push constants enable the shader to be flexible and adaptable to different data layouts and processing requirements.

The main function of the shader calculates indices for accessing the input and output buffers based on the workgroup and local invocation IDs. It performs a loop over the local invocation ID to process elements of the input tensor and store the results in the output buffer. The shader's logic involves calculating the appropriate indices for reading from the input buffer and writing to the output buffer, ensuring that data is correctly transformed and stored. This shader is a critical component in GPU-accelerated applications that require efficient tensor operations, such as machine learning or scientific computing tasks.
# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function is a compute shader that processes input tensor data and writes the transformed data to an output buffer using specified offsets and dimensions.
- **Inputs**:
    - `gl_WorkGroupID`: A built-in variable that provides the current workgroup's ID in the 3D grid of workgroups.
    - `gl_LocalInvocationID`: A built-in variable that provides the current invocation's ID within the local workgroup.
    - `gl_WorkGroupSize`: A built-in constant that specifies the size of the workgroup.
    - `pcs`: A uniform block containing push constants that define offsets and dimensions for input and output tensors.
    - `in_`: A read-only buffer containing the input tensor data of type `float16_t`.
    - `out_`: A write-only buffer where the output tensor data of type `float16_t` will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the linear index `n` based on the workgroup IDs and the dimensions specified in `pcs`.
    - Derive the multi-dimensional indices `i3`, `i2`, `i1`, and `i0` from the linear index `n` using the dimensions in `pcs`.
    - Compute the destination data index `dst_data` in the output buffer using the derived indices and the output offset `pcs.outOff`.
    - Iterate over the local invocation ID `i00` to process each element in the input tensor, adjusting for the workgroup size.
    - For each element, calculate the source index `src` in the input buffer using the input offset `pcs.inOff`.
    - Convert the input data from `in_` at index `src` to `OUT_TYPE` and store it in the output buffer `out_` at the calculated `dst_data` index.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it writes processed data to the `out_` buffer.
