# Purpose
This code is a GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) compute shader, which is designed to perform parallel computations on the GPU. The shader is configured to operate with a specific local workgroup size, as indicated by the `layout(local_size_x_id = 0)`, `layout(local_size_y = 8)`, and `layout(local_size_z = 1)` directives. These settings define the dimensions of the workgroup, which is a fundamental unit of work in GPU computing, allowing the shader to efficiently process data in parallel.

The shader interacts with three buffer objects, as specified by the `layout (binding = X)` directives. These buffers are `tensorInA`, `tensorInB`, and `tensorOut`, which are used for reading and writing data. `tensorInA` is a read-only buffer containing `uint8_t` data, while `tensorInB` is a read-only buffer containing `float` data. The `tensorOut` buffer is write-only and is intended to store the results of the computations performed by the shader. This setup suggests that the shader is likely involved in processing or transforming data from the input buffers and storing the results in the output buffer.

Additionally, the shader uses a `push_constant` block named `parameter`, which provides a set of uniform variables that can be used to control the shader's behavior. These variables include offsets (`inAOff`, `inBOff`, `outOff`), dimensions (`ne00`, `ne01`, `ne02`, `ne10`, `ne12`, `ne0`, `ne1`), and other parameters (`nb01`, `nb02`, `nb03`, `nb11`, `nb12`, `nb13`, `r2`, `r3`) that likely influence how the input data is processed and how the output is generated. The use of push constants allows for efficient updates of these parameters without the need to re-upload large amounts of data to the GPU, making the shader flexible and adaptable to different computational tasks.
