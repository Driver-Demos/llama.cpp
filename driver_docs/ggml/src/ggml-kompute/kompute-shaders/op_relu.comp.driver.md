# Purpose
This code is a GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) compute shader, which is designed to perform parallel computations on the GPU. The shader is written for version 450 of GLSL and includes a common component file, "common.comp," which likely contains shared definitions or functions used across multiple shader programs. The primary purpose of this shader is to apply a rectified linear unit (ReLU) operation on an input tensor, which is a common operation in neural networks and deep learning applications. The ReLU function outputs the input directly if it is greater than zero; otherwise, it outputs zero.

The shader defines two buffer objects: `tensorIn` and `tensorOut`, which are used to read input data and write output data, respectively. These buffers are bound to specific binding points (0 and 1) and are accessed using the `restrict` keyword to optimize memory access patterns. The shader also utilizes push constants, defined in the `PushConstants` uniform block, to pass small amounts of data (offsets in this case) from the CPU to the GPU efficiently. The `main` function calculates a base index using the workgroup ID and processes four elements at a time, applying the ReLU operation and storing the results in the output buffer.

This shader provides narrow functionality focused on tensor manipulation, specifically applying the ReLU activation function. It is not a standalone executable but rather a component intended to be integrated into a larger graphics or compute pipeline. The shader does not define public APIs or external interfaces beyond the standard GLSL constructs, as it is meant to be invoked by a host application that manages the GPU execution context.
# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function processes a segment of an input buffer by applying a ReLU operation and writes the result to an output buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `tensorIn`: A read-only buffer containing the input float array `in_[]`.
    - `tensorOut`: A write-only buffer for the output float array `out_[]`.
    - `pcs`: A uniform structure containing push constants `inOff` and `outOff` which are offsets for input and output buffers respectively.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate `baseIndex` using the x-component of the workgroup ID multiplied by 4.
    - Iterate over a loop with 4 iterations, indexed by `x`.
    - In each iteration, calculate the index `i` as `baseIndex + x`.
    - Apply the ReLU operation by taking the maximum of 0.0 and the input value at `in_[i + pcs.inOff]`.
    - Store the result of the ReLU operation in the output buffer at `out_[i + pcs.outOff]`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it writes processed data to the `tensorOut` buffer.
