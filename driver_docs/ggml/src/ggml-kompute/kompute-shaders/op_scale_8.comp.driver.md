# Purpose
This code is a GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) compute shader, which is designed to perform parallel computations on the GPU. The shader is written for version 450 of GLSL and is intended to process data in a highly efficient manner by leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of modern graphics hardware. The primary function of this shader is to read data from an input buffer, apply a scaling transformation, and write the results to an output buffer. This is achieved through the use of a compute shader, which is a type of shader that does not produce graphics directly but instead performs general-purpose computations.

The shader includes several key components. It uses buffer objects to handle input and output data, with `tensorIn` and `tensorOut` representing the input and output buffers, respectively. These buffers are accessed using the `restrict readonly` and `restrict writeonly` qualifiers to optimize memory access patterns. The shader also utilizes push constants, defined in the `PushConstants` structure, to pass small amounts of data to the shader, such as offsets and a scaling factor. The `main` function is the entry point of the shader, where it calculates a base index for processing a segment of the data and iterates over a fixed range to apply the scaling transformation to each element.

This compute shader provides a narrow but essential functionality within a larger graphics or computation pipeline, focusing on data transformation tasks. It is likely part of a broader system that requires efficient data processing, such as machine learning inference, image processing, or scientific simulations. The shader does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly but is intended to be integrated into a larger application that manages the setup and execution of compute shaders on the GPU.
# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function performs a scaled copy of input tensor elements to an output tensor using GPU compute shaders.
- **Inputs**:
    - `tensorIn`: A read-only buffer containing the input tensor elements as a float array.
    - `tensorOut`: A write-only buffer where the scaled output tensor elements will be stored as a float array.
    - `pcs`: A uniform block of push constants containing three values: `inOff` (input offset), `outOff` (output offset), and `scale` (scaling factor).
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate `baseIndex` using the x-component of the work group ID multiplied by 8.
    - Iterate over a loop with 8 iterations, indexed by `x`.
    - In each iteration, calculate the index `i` as `baseIndex + x`.
    - For each `i`, compute the scaled value by multiplying the input element at `i + pcs.inOff` by `pcs.scale`.
    - Store the scaled value in the output buffer at index `i + pcs.outOff`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it writes scaled values to the `tensorOut` buffer.
