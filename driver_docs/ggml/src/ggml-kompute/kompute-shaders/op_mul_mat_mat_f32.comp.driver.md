# Purpose
This code is a GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) compute shader designed to perform parallel computations on the GPU. It is specifically tailored for operations involving tensor data, as indicated by the use of buffer objects `tensorInA`, `tensorInB`, and `tensorOut`, which are used to read input tensors and write the output tensor, respectively. The shader utilizes advanced features such as shader subgroups, enabled by the `GL_KHR_shader_subgroup_arithmetic` extension, to perform efficient parallel reductions and arithmetic operations across workgroup invocations.

The shader is structured to handle tensor operations by leveraging the GPU's parallel processing capabilities. It uses a push constant block to pass various parameters, such as offsets and dimensions of the input and output tensors, which are crucial for indexing and computation within the shader. The main function calculates indices based on the workgroup and subgroup IDs, performs element-wise multiplication of the input tensors, and accumulates the results using the `subgroupAdd` function. This function efficiently sums values across a subgroup, and the result is conditionally written to the output buffer by the first active invocation in the subgroup, as determined by `subgroupElect`.

Overall, this shader provides a specialized and efficient mechanism for performing tensor operations on the GPU, making it suitable for applications in fields such as machine learning and scientific computing where large-scale data processing is required. The use of shader subgroups and push constants allows for fine-grained control over the computation, optimizing performance by minimizing memory access and maximizing parallel execution.

# Functions

### main
The `main` function performs a parallel matrix multiplication using GPU shader capabilities and writes the result to an output buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `None`: The function does not take any direct input parameters, but it uses global variables and buffers defined outside the function.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the workgroup ID using `gl_WorkGroupID` to determine the current execution context.
    - Calculate broadcast indices `bc_ab` and `bc_ba` based on the comparison of `pcs.ne12` and `pcs.ne02`.
    - Compute the starting indices `x` and `y` for accessing elements in the input buffers `inA` and `inB`, respectively, using the workgroup ID and push constants.
    - Initialize a `sum` variable to accumulate the product of corresponding elements from `inA` and `inB`.
    - Iterate over elements in the subgroup using `gl_SubgroupInvocationID.x` and `gl_SubgroupSize` to perform partial dot product calculations.
    - Use `subgroupAdd` to compute the sum of all partial results within the subgroup and store it in `all_sum`.
    - Check if the current invocation is the elected one using `subgroupElect`, and if so, write the `all_sum` to the output buffer `out_` at the calculated index.
- **Output**: The function writes the computed sum of products (result of matrix multiplication) to the `out_` buffer at a specific index.
