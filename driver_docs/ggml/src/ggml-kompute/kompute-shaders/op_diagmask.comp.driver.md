# Purpose
This code is a compute shader written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) version 4.50. It is designed to perform operations on data buffers, specifically for processing tensor data. The shader is structured to work with two buffers: a read-only input buffer (`tensorIn`) and a write-only output buffer (`tensorOut`). The primary function of this shader is to copy data from the input buffer to the output buffer, with certain conditions applied based on the indices of the data elements. The shader uses a push constant block to receive parameters that control the offsets and dimensions of the data being processed.

The shader operates within a compute grid defined by `gl_WorkGroupID`, which provides the indices for the workgroup in three dimensions (x, y, z). The main logic of the shader calculates a linear index from these workgroup IDs and uses it to access the appropriate elements in the input and output buffers. A conditional check is performed to determine whether the data should be copied directly or if a special floating-point value (`0xFF800000`, representing negative infinity) should be written to the output buffer. This condition is based on the `n_past` parameter and the current indices, allowing for selective data processing.

Overall, this shader provides a narrow functionality focused on tensor data manipulation within a GPU compute context. It is a specialized component likely used in a larger graphics or compute pipeline, where efficient data processing on the GPU is required. The inclusion of a common header file (`common.comp`) suggests that this shader may be part of a suite of shaders sharing common definitions or utilities.
# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function processes a 3D grid of workgroups to copy or set specific values in an output buffer based on a condition involving input buffer indices and push constants.
- **Inputs**:
    - `gl_WorkGroupID`: A built-in variable that provides the current workgroup's 3D index (x, y, z).
    - `tensorIn`: A read-only buffer containing input float values.
    - `tensorOut`: A write-only buffer where output float values are stored.
    - `pcs (PushConstants)`: A uniform structure containing push constants: `inOff` (input offset), `outOff` (output offset), `n_past` (a threshold value), `ne00` and `ne01` (dimensions for index calculation).
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the 3D workgroup indices `i02`, `i01`, and `i00` from `gl_WorkGroupID`.
    - Calculate a linear index using the formula `i02*pcs.ne01*pcs.ne00 + i01*pcs.ne00 + i00`.
    - Check if `i00` is greater than `pcs.n_past + i01`.
    - If true, set the output buffer at the calculated index plus `pcs.outOff` to the float representation of the bit pattern `0xFF800000`.
    - If false, copy the value from the input buffer at the calculated index plus `pcs.inOff` to the output buffer at the same index plus `pcs.outOff`.
- **Output**: The function writes to the `tensorOut` buffer, either copying a value from `tensorIn` or setting a specific float value based on a condition.
