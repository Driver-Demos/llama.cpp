# Purpose
This code is a GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) compute shader designed to perform parallel computations on the GPU. It is specifically written for the OpenGL 4.5 version, as indicated by the `#version 450` directive. The shader is responsible for performing element-wise addition of two input buffers, `inA` and `inB`, and storing the result in an output buffer, `out_`. The use of compute shaders allows for efficient parallel processing, making this code suitable for high-performance tasks such as matrix operations or other data-parallel computations.

The shader utilizes several key components to achieve its functionality. It defines three buffer objects using the `layout(binding = X) buffer` syntax, which are used to read from the input buffers and write to the output buffer. The `restrict readonly` and `restrict writeonly` qualifiers are used to optimize memory access patterns by indicating that the buffers are only read from or written to, respectively. The `layout(push_constant) uniform PushConstants` structure is used to pass additional parameters to the shader, such as offsets and the number of rows, which are essential for correctly indexing into the buffers during computation.

The `main` function is the entry point of the shader, where the actual computation takes place. It calculates a `baseIndex` using the `gl_WorkGroupID.x` built-in variable, which helps in determining the starting point for processing within the workgroup. A loop iterates over a fixed range, performing the addition of corresponding elements from the input buffers and storing the result in the output buffer. The use of `gl_WorkGroupID` and the loop structure allows the shader to handle multiple elements in parallel, leveraging the GPU's architecture for efficient computation. This shader is a specialized component within a larger graphics or compute pipeline, focusing on data manipulation tasks that benefit from parallel execution.
# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function performs element-wise addition of two input buffers and stores the result in an output buffer, using specific offsets and a row size for indexing.
- **Inputs**:
    - `inA`: A buffer of floats, accessed as a read-only input tensor, representing the first operand for addition.
    - `inB`: A buffer of floats, accessed as a read-only input tensor, representing the second operand for addition.
    - `out_`: A buffer of floats, accessed as a write-only output tensor, where the result of the addition is stored.
    - `pcs`: A uniform structure containing push constants: `inAOff`, `inBOff`, `outOff`, and `row`, which are used for offsetting and indexing the input and output buffers.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate `baseIndex` using the x-component of the work group ID multiplied by 4.
    - Iterate over a loop with 4 iterations, using `x` as the loop variable.
    - In each iteration, calculate the index `i` as `baseIndex + x`.
    - Compute the output index as `i + pcs.outOff` and store the sum of `inA[i + pcs.inAOff]` and `inB[(i % pcs.row) + pcs.inBOff]` into `out_` at this index.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it writes the result of the addition directly into the `out_` buffer.
