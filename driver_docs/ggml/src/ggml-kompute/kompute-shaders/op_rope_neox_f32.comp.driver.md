# Purpose
This code is a GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) compute shader, which is designed to perform parallel computations on the GPU. The shader is written in GLSL version 450 and is intended to process tensor data, as indicated by the use of buffer objects for input and output. The shader reads from three input buffers (`tensorInA`, `tensorInB`, and `tensorInC`) and writes results to an output buffer (`tensorOut`). The primary function of this shader is to perform a series of mathematical transformations on the input data, specifically involving trigonometric operations and frequency-based scaling, which are common in signal processing or machine learning applications.

The shader utilizes several key components and functions, such as `rope_yarn_corr_dims` and `rope_yarn`, which are likely defined in the included file "rope_common.comp". These functions are used to calculate correction dimensions and perform transformations based on frequency and angle calculations. The shader makes use of the `gl_WorkGroupID` and `gl_LocalInvocationIndex` to manage parallel execution across different workgroups and invocations, allowing it to efficiently process large datasets by dividing the workload among multiple threads on the GPU.

Overall, this shader is a specialized piece of code that provides narrow functionality focused on tensor manipulation and transformation. It is not a standalone executable but rather a component that would be integrated into a larger graphics or compute pipeline, where it would be invoked to perform its specific task as part of a broader application, such as a graphics engine or a machine learning framework. The shader does not define public APIs or external interfaces but instead operates within the context of a GPU-based computation framework.

# Functions

### main
The `main` function performs a transformation on input tensors using a combination of trigonometric operations and frequency scaling, and writes the results to an output tensor.
- **Inputs**:
    - `inA`: A buffer of floats representing the input tensor A.
    - `inB`: A buffer of integers representing the input tensor B, used for base theta calculations.
    - `inC`: A buffer of floats representing the input tensor C, used for frequency factor calculations.
    - `out_`: A buffer of floats where the transformed output tensor is written.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the workgroup IDs for the z, y, and x dimensions and store them in `i3`, `i2`, and `i1` respectively.
    - Calculate the correction dimensions using `rope_yarn_corr_dims` with parameters from `pcs`.
    - Compute `theta_scale` using the power of `pcs.freq_base` and `pcs.n_dims`.
    - Retrieve `theta_base` from `inB` using an offset and calculate `inv_ndims`.
    - Iterate over local invocation indices, adjusting by the workgroup size, to process elements in `inA`.
    - For each element, calculate `theta` and determine the frequency factor from `inC` if applicable.
    - Call `rope_yarn` to compute `cos_theta` and `sin_theta` for the current `theta`.
    - Calculate source and destination indices for reading from `inA` and writing to `out_`.
    - Perform trigonometric transformations on elements of `inA` and store the results in `out_`.
    - If the current index exceeds `pcs.n_dims`, copy elements directly from `inA` to `out_` without transformation.
- **Output**: The function writes transformed data to the `out_` buffer, which is a float array representing the output tensor.
