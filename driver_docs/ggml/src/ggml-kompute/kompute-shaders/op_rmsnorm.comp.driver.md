# Purpose
This code is a GLSL compute shader designed to perform a parallel reduction operation on input data, specifically to normalize a tensor. It is intended to be executed on a GPU, leveraging parallel processing capabilities to efficiently compute the sum of squares of input elements, normalize them, and store the results in an output buffer. The shader is written for OpenGL Shading Language version 450 and includes a common component file, "common.comp," which likely contains shared definitions or functions used across multiple shader programs.

The shader operates on two buffer objects: `tensorIn` and `tensorOut`, which are bound to specific binding points and are used to read input data and write output data, respectively. The shader uses a push constant block to receive parameters such as offsets and dimensions, which control the processing of the input and output data. The main computational task involves calculating the sum of squares of the input elements in parallel, reducing this sum to a single value, and then using this value to normalize the input data before writing it to the output buffer.

Key technical components include the use of shared memory for efficient inter-thread communication within a workgroup, barriers to synchronize threads, and memory barriers to ensure correct memory access ordering. The shader employs a parallel reduction algorithm to compute the sum of squares, followed by a normalization step that scales the input data based on the computed sum and a small epsilon value to prevent division by zero. This shader is a specialized piece of code focused on tensor normalization, making it a narrow functionality component within a larger graphics or compute pipeline.
