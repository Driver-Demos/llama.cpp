# Purpose
This code is a GLSL compute shader designed to perform tensor operations, specifically involving rotations and transformations of input data. The shader is written in GLSL version 450 and is intended to be executed on a GPU, leveraging parallel processing capabilities for efficient computation. The shader reads from three input buffers (`tensorInA`, `tensorInB`, and `tensorInC`) and writes the results to an output buffer (`tensorOut`). The input buffers contain data of different types: `tensorInA` holds 16-bit floating-point numbers, `tensorInB` contains integers, and `tensorInC` includes 32-bit floating-point numbers. The output buffer is designed to store 16-bit floating-point results.

The main functionality of this shader revolves around computing rotations using trigonometric transformations. It calculates rotation angles (`theta`) based on input parameters and applies these rotations to the input data from `tensorInA`. The shader uses helper functions like `rope_yarn_corr_dims` and `rope_yarn` to compute the necessary dimensions and trigonometric values (cosine and sine) for the rotations. These computations are influenced by various parameters such as frequency base, scaling factors, and context dimensions, which are likely defined in the included file "rope_common.comp". The shader processes data in parallel using workgroup and local invocation indices, which are typical in GPU programming to handle large datasets efficiently.

Overall, this shader is a specialized component of a larger graphics or computational pipeline, likely used in applications requiring high-performance tensor manipulations, such as machine learning or scientific simulations. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly but serves as a backend computational unit that can be integrated into broader systems requiring GPU-accelerated tensor operations.
# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function performs a transformation on input tensors using a combination of trigonometric operations and frequency scaling, and writes the results to an output tensor.
- **Inputs**:
    - `gl_WorkGroupID`: A built-in variable providing the workgroup's ID in the z, y, and x dimensions.
    - `gl_LocalInvocationIndex`: A built-in variable providing the index of the local invocation within the workgroup.
    - `gl_WorkGroupSize`: A built-in variable providing the size of the workgroup.
    - `pcs`: A structure containing various parameters such as dimensions, offsets, frequency base, and scaling factors used in the computation.
    - `inA`: A buffer containing input tensor data of type float16_t.
    - `inB`: A buffer containing input tensor data of type int.
    - `inC`: A buffer containing input tensor data of type float.
    - `out_`: A buffer for writing the output tensor data of type float16_t.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize indices i3, i2, and i1 from the workgroup ID components.
    - Calculate correction dimensions using the `rope_yarn_corr_dims` function.
    - Compute `theta_scale` using the frequency base and number of dimensions.
    - Retrieve `theta_base` from the inB buffer and calculate `inv_ndims`.
    - Iterate over local invocation indices, adjusting by workgroup size, to process elements of the input tensor.
    - For each element, check if the index is within the number of dimensions.
    - If within dimensions, calculate `theta`, `freq_factor`, and call `rope_yarn` to get `cos_theta` and `sin_theta`.
    - Compute source and destination indices for input and output buffers.
    - Perform trigonometric transformations on input data and store results in the output buffer.
    - If the index is not within dimensions, directly copy input data to the output buffer.
- **Output**: The function writes transformed data to the `out_` buffer, which is a tensor of type float16_t.
