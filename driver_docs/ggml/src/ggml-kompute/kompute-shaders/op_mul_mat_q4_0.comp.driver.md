# Purpose
This source code file is a shader program written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) targeting version 4.50. It is designed to perform specialized mathematical operations on data, specifically focusing on matrix-vector multiplication using quantized data formats. The file includes several components and defines macros that are used to configure the behavior of the operations, such as `BLOCKS_IN_QUANT`, `SIZE_OF_BLOCK`, and `N_ROWS`. These macros are likely used to handle different quantization levels and block sizes, which are critical for optimizing performance in graphics or compute-intensive applications.

The primary function defined in this file, `block_q_n_dot_y`, performs a dot product operation on a block of data. It utilizes quantized data, as indicated by the use of functions like `u8BufToFloat16` and `u8BufToU16`, which convert data from an 8-bit buffer to floating-point and 16-bit unsigned integer formats, respectively. The function accumulates results in a vector `acc` and computes a final result by combining these accumulations with a scaling factor `d` and a sum of selected elements from an input buffer `inB`. This operation is likely part of a larger pipeline for processing quantized data efficiently, which is common in graphics rendering or machine learning inference tasks where performance is critical.

The file includes other shader components, such as `common.comp`, `op_mul_mv_q_n_pre.comp`, and `op_mul_mv_q_n.comp`, suggesting that it is part of a modular shader system. These included files likely provide shared functions, definitions, or additional operations that complement the functionality of this shader. The modular structure allows for reusability and easier maintenance of the shader code, enabling developers to adapt the shader for different quantization schemes or computational tasks by modifying or extending these components.
# Functions

---
### block\_q\_n\_dot\_y
The function `block_q_n_dot_y` computes a weighted dot product of a block of quantized data with a vector, applying specific scaling and accumulation operations.
- **Inputs**:
    - `block_index`: The index of the block in the quantized data array to be processed.
    - `yb`: The base index in the vector `inB` from which elements are accessed for the dot product computation.
    - `il`: An offset used in accessing elements within the block of quantized data.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a 2D vector `acc` to store intermediate accumulation results.
    - Calculate the starting index for the block in the quantized data using `block_index` and `SIZE_OF_BLOCK`.
    - Convert a byte from the quantized data at the calculated index to a float `d`.
    - Initialize `sumy` to accumulate the sum of selected elements from the vector `inB`.
    - Iterate over the block in steps of 2, processing pairs of elements from the quantized data and vector `inB`.
    - For each pair, extract a 16-bit value `b` from the quantized data and corresponding elements from `inB`.
    - Accumulate the sum of the selected elements from `inB` into `sumy`.
    - Update `acc[0]` and `acc[1]` with weighted contributions from the elements of `inB` and the extracted bits from `b`.
    - Return the final result by scaling `d` with a combination of `sumy` and the accumulated values in `acc`.
- **Output**: A floating-point value representing the computed weighted dot product of the block with the vector.
