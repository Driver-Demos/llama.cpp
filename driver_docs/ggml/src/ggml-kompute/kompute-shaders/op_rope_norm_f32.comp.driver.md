# Purpose
This code is a GLSL compute shader designed to perform tensor operations, specifically involving trigonometric transformations on input data. The shader is written in GLSL version 450 and includes a common component file, "rope_common.comp," which likely contains shared functions or definitions used across multiple shaders. The shader operates on three input buffers (`tensorInA`, `tensorInB`, and `tensorInC`) and writes results to an output buffer (`tensorOut`). The input buffers are read-only, while the output buffer is write-only, indicating that the shader's primary function is to process and transform the input data into a new form stored in the output buffer.

The shader's main function utilizes the GPU's parallel processing capabilities by leveraging workgroup and local invocation indices to distribute the workload across multiple threads. It calculates trigonometric values (`cos_theta` and `sin_theta`) based on input parameters and applies these to the input data (`inA`) to produce transformed output data (`out_`). The transformation involves a rotation operation, which is a common technique in graphics and signal processing to manipulate data in a multi-dimensional space. The shader also accounts for frequency scaling and correction dimensions, which suggests its use in applications requiring precise control over data transformations, such as machine learning, scientific simulations, or advanced graphics rendering.

Overall, this shader provides a specialized functionality focused on tensor manipulation with trigonometric transformations. It is part of a larger system, as indicated by the inclusion of a common component file, and is designed to be executed on a GPU to take advantage of parallel processing for efficient computation. The shader does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly, but it is likely part of a larger framework or application that manages its execution and data flow.
# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function performs a tensor transformation using a rotation operation based on frequency scaling and writes the result to an output buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `inA`: A buffer of float values representing the input tensor A.
    - `inB`: A buffer of integer values used to compute the base angle for rotation.
    - `inC`: A buffer of float values used as frequency factors if applicable.
    - `out_`: A buffer of float values where the transformed tensor will be written.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the workgroup IDs for the current invocation to determine the indices i1, i2, and i3.
    - Calculate the correction dimensions using the `rope_yarn_corr_dims` function with parameters from the `pcs` structure.
    - Compute the `theta_scale` using the frequency base and number of dimensions.
    - Retrieve the base angle `theta_base` from the `inB` buffer and calculate `inv_ndims`.
    - Iterate over the local invocation index to process elements of the input tensor in pairs.
    - For each pair, calculate the angle `theta` and determine the frequency factor if applicable.
    - Use the `rope_yarn` function to compute the cosine and sine of the adjusted angle for rotation.
    - Calculate source and destination indices for reading from `inA` and writing to `out_`.
    - Perform the rotation transformation on the input values and store the result in the output buffer.
    - If the index exceeds the number of dimensions, copy the input values directly to the output buffer without transformation.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it writes the transformed tensor data to the `out_` buffer.
