# Purpose
This code is a GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) compute shader, which is designed to perform parallel computations on the GPU. The shader is written for version 450 of GLSL and is intended to process data in a highly efficient manner by leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of modern graphics hardware. The primary functionality of this shader is to apply a sigmoid activation function to a segment of an input tensor and store the results in an output tensor. This is a common operation in neural networks and other machine learning applications, where activation functions are used to introduce non-linearity into the model.

The shader includes a common component file, "common.comp," which likely contains shared definitions or functions used across multiple shader programs. It defines two buffer objects: `tensorIn` for reading input data and `tensorOut` for writing output data. These buffers are accessed using the `restrict` keyword to optimize memory access patterns. The shader also utilizes push constants, a feature that allows small amounts of data to be passed to the shader without the overhead of buffer objects, to specify offsets for reading from and writing to the buffers. The `main` function calculates a base index using the workgroup ID and iterates over a fixed range to apply the sigmoid function to each element in the input buffer, storing the result in the output buffer.

Overall, this shader provides a narrow but essential functionality within a larger graphics or compute pipeline, likely as part of a machine learning inference or training process. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces but rather serves as a specialized component that can be integrated into a broader system to perform specific mathematical transformations on data.
# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function processes a segment of an input buffer by applying the sigmoid function to each element and storing the result in an output buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `tensorIn`: A read-only buffer containing the input float array `in_[]`.
    - `tensorOut`: A write-only buffer for the output float array `out_[]`.
    - `pcs`: A uniform structure containing push constants `inOff` and `outOff` which are offsets for input and output buffers respectively.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate `baseIndex` using the x-component of the workgroup ID multiplied by 4.
    - Iterate over a loop with 4 iterations, indexed by `x`.
    - In each iteration, calculate the index `i` as `baseIndex + x`.
    - Retrieve the input value `y` from `in_[]` using the index `i` offset by `pcs.inOff`.
    - Apply the sigmoid function to `y` and store the result in `out_[]` at index `i` offset by `pcs.outOff`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it writes the processed data to the `tensorOut` buffer.
