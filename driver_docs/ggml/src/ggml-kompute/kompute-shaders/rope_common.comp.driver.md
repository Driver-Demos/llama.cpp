# Purpose
This source code file is a shader program that appears to be part of a larger graphics or computational framework, likely related to GPU-based computations. The file defines a set of functions and constants that are used to perform operations related to the "YaRN" algorithm, which is based on the LlamaYaRNScaledRotaryEmbedding.py script. The primary purpose of this code is to handle rotational scaling and correction for extrapolation in a multi-dimensional space, which is a common requirement in graphics and machine learning applications involving spatial transformations or embeddings.

The file includes a push constant block that defines a set of parameters used by the shader, such as offsets, dimensions, frequency scaling factors, and other configuration variables. These parameters are crucial for the shader's operation, as they dictate how the input data is processed and transformed. The functions `rope_yarn`, `rope_yarn_corr_factor`, and `rope_yarn_corr_dims` implement the core logic of the YaRN algorithm, which involves calculating corrected rotational angles and scaling factors for given input dimensions and frequency parameters. The `rope_yarn_ramp` function is used to compute a ramping factor that adjusts the interpolation and extrapolation of these transformations.

Overall, this file provides specialized functionality for handling rotational embeddings in a computationally efficient manner, leveraging GPU capabilities. It is likely part of a library or module that can be integrated into larger systems requiring advanced spatial transformations, such as neural networks or graphics rendering engines. The inclusion of a specific algorithm from an external source, along with the use of shader-specific constructs like `layout` and `push_constant`, indicates that this code is designed to be executed on a GPU, making it suitable for high-performance applications.

# Functions

### rope\_yarn\_ramp
The `rope_yarn_ramp` function calculates a normalized ramp value based on input parameters to adjust rotational scaling in a neural network context.
- **Inputs**:
    - `low`: The lower bound of the range for normalization.
    - `high`: The upper bound of the range for normalization.
    - `i0`: The current index or position to be normalized within the range.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the normalized value `y` by dividing the adjusted index `i0/2 - low` by the range `high - low`, ensuring the denominator is not zero by using `max(0.001f, high - low)`.
    - Clamp the normalized value `y` between 0.0 and 1.0 using `max` and `min` functions.
    - Return the complement of the clamped value, `1.0f - clamped_value`, to produce the final ramp value.
- **Output**: A float value representing the normalized ramp, clamped between 0.0 and 1.0, and inverted.

### rope\_yarn
The `rope_yarn` function calculates the cosine and sine of a rotational angle with scaling and extrapolation corrections for n-dimensional embeddings.
- **Inputs**:
    - `theta_extrap`: A float representing the extrapolated rotational angle.
    - `freq_scale`: A float representing the frequency scaling factor.
    - `corr_dims`: An array of two floats representing the correction dimensions.
    - `i0`: A float representing the initial index or position.
    - `ext_factor`: A float representing the external factor for extrapolation correction.
    - `mscale`: A float representing the magnitude scaling factor.
    - `cos_theta`: An output float to store the calculated cosine of the corrected angle.
    - `sin_theta`: An output float to store the calculated sine of the corrected angle.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the interpolated angle `theta_interp` by multiplying `freq_scale` with `theta_extrap`.
    - Initialize `theta` with `theta_interp`.
    - If `ext_factor` is not zero, calculate `ramp_mix` using `rope_yarn_ramp` and adjust `theta` by mixing `theta_interp` and `theta_extrap` based on `ramp_mix`.
    - Adjust `mscale` by a logarithmic factor if `ext_factor` is not zero.
    - Calculate `cos_theta` as the cosine of `theta` multiplied by `mscale`.
    - Calculate `sin_theta` as the sine of `theta` multiplied by `mscale`.
- **Output**: The function outputs the corrected cosine and sine values of the rotational angle through the `cos_theta` and `sin_theta` parameters.

### rope\_yarn\_corr\_factor
The function `rope_yarn_corr_factor` calculates a correction factor for rotational scaling based on the number of dimensions, original context size, rotation value, and frequency base.

    - `n_ctx_orig`: The original context size used in the calculation.
    - `n_rot`: The rotation value for which the correction factor is being calculated.
    - `base`: The frequency base used in the logarithmic calculation.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the logarithm of the ratio of the original context size to the product of the rotation value and 2Ï€.

    - `dims`: An output array of size 2 to store the calculated start and end correction dimensions.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the start correction dimension using `rope_yarn_corr_factor` with `beta_fast` and store the floored value in `dims[0]`.
    - Calculate the end correction dimension using `rope_yarn_corr_factor` with `beta_slow` and store the ceiled value in `dims[1]`.
