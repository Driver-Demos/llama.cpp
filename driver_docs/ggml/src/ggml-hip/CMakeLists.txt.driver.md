# Purpose
This file is a CMake configuration script used to set up a build environment for a software project that utilizes the ROCm (Radeon Open Compute) platform, specifically targeting HIP (Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability) and related libraries like hipBLAS and rocBLAS. It provides narrow functionality focused on configuring the build system to correctly locate and use the ROCm toolchain and libraries, ensuring compatibility with the required versions and setting necessary compiler flags. The script includes logic to determine the ROCm installation path, checks for the presence of specific components, and sets up the build environment to compile and link against HIP and related libraries. It also includes conditional logic to handle different operating systems and compiler configurations, ensuring that the project can be built correctly across various environments. This file is crucial for developers working on this codebase as it automates the setup of the build environment, ensuring that all dependencies are correctly configured and available.
# Content Summary
This configuration file is a CMake script designed to set up a build environment for a project that utilizes AMD's ROCm (Radeon Open Compute) platform, specifically focusing on HIP (Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability) and related libraries like hipBLAS and rocBLAS. The script begins by determining the appropriate path for the ROCm installation, defaulting to `/usr` if neither the `ROCM_PATH` environment variable nor the `/opt/rocm` directory exists. It appends this path to the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to ensure CMake can locate the necessary ROCm components.

The script includes logic to handle different operating systems, particularly distinguishing between Windows and Linux environments. On Windows, it sets a flag indicating the use of HIPCC, while on Linux, it checks if the C++ compiler is `hipcc` and issues warnings if the compiler is not LLVM, as only LLVM is supported for HIP. It also advises against using `hipcc` as the C++ compiler, suggesting setting the HIP compiler directly.

The script ensures that the required HIP, hipBLAS, and rocBLAS packages are found and checks for the presence of the `rocwmma` library if a specific feature (`GGML_HIP_ROCWMMA_FATTN`) is enabled. It enforces a minimum version requirement for HIP, ensuring that version 5.5 or higher is used.

The script configures various compile-time definitions based on the presence of certain flags, such as `GGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS`, `GGML_CUDA_FORCE_MMQ`, and others, which control specific features and optimizations in the build process. It also sets up source files and headers related to the `ggml-cuda` component, appending them to the build target `ggml-hip`.

Finally, the script links the `ggml-hip` target with necessary libraries, including `ggml-base`, `hip::host`, `roc::rocblas`, and `roc::hipblas`, and sets properties for source files based on whether `hipcc` is used. It explicitly disallows static linking for HIP/ROCm, indicating that only dynamic linking is supported. This setup ensures that the project is correctly configured to leverage the capabilities of the ROCm platform for GPU-accelerated computations.
