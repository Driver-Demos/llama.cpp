# Purpose
This source code file provides a set of utility functions and macros for interfacing with the MUDNN library, which is part of the Musa deep neural network framework. The file includes functions for error handling, resource management, and data manipulation, specifically tailored for operations involving MUDNN. The code defines a function `mudnnGetErrorString` that translates MUDNN status codes into human-readable error messages, facilitating easier debugging and error tracking. Additionally, it includes a macro `MUDNN_CHECK` for error checking, which ensures that MUDNN operations are executed successfully and provides meaningful error messages when they fail.

The file also manages MUDNN handle objects in a thread-safe manner using a cache mechanism. This is achieved through the `get_cached_handle` function, which retrieves or creates a `mudnn::Handle` object for a specific device, ensuring efficient resource management across multiple threads. This approach minimizes the overhead of repeatedly creating and destroying handle objects, which are essential for executing MUDNN operations on different devices.

Furthermore, the file includes functions for converting data types and performing asynchronous memory operations. The `get_ggml_dims_and_strides` function extracts dimensions and strides from a `ggml_tensor`, which is necessary for setting up tensor operations in MUDNN. The `ggml_type_to_mudnn_type` function maps `ggml_type` to `mudnn::Tensor::Type`, ensuring compatibility between different data representations. The `mudnnMemcpyAsync` function performs an asynchronous memory copy operation using MUDNN's unary operations, demonstrating how to set up and execute tensor operations within the MUDNN framework. Overall, this file serves as a crucial component for integrating and managing MUDNN operations within a larger application, providing essential utilities for error handling, resource management, and data manipulation.

# Functions

### mudnnGetErrorString
The function `mudnnGetErrorString` returns a human-readable string that describes the error status of a `mudnn::Status` code.
- **Inputs**:
    - `err`: A `mudnn::Status` enumeration value representing the error code for which a human-readable string is needed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses a switch statement to match the input `err` against various `mudnn::Status` enumeration values.
    - For each case in the switch statement, a corresponding human-readable string is returned.
    - If the `err` does not match any known `mudnn::Status` values, the default case returns the string "Unknown mudnn status".
- **Output**: A constant character pointer (`const char*`) that points to a string describing the error status.


---
### get\_cached\_handle
The `get_cached_handle` function retrieves or creates a thread-safe cached `mudnn::Handle` object for a specified device ID.
- **Inputs**:
    - `device_id`: An integer representing the ID of the device for which the `mudnn::Handle` is requested.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Acquire a lock on the `handle_cache_mutex` to ensure thread safety.
    - Check if a `mudnn::Handle` for the given `device_id` exists in the `handle_cache`.
    - If the handle exists, return the existing handle.
    - If the handle does not exist, create a new `mudnn::Handle` for the given `device_id`.
    - Store the newly created handle in the `handle_cache` and return it.
- **Output**: A pointer to a `mudnn::Handle` object associated with the specified device ID.


---
### get\_ggml\_dims\_and\_strides
The function `get_ggml_dims_and_strides` extracts the dimensions and strides from a given `ggml_tensor` and stores them in provided vectors.
- **Inputs**:
    - `tensor`: A pointer to a `ggml_tensor` from which dimensions and strides are to be extracted.
    - `dims`: A reference to a vector of int64_t where the dimensions of the tensor will be stored.
    - `strides`: A reference to a vector of int64_t where the strides of the tensor will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the number of dimensions `ndims` from the `ggml_tensor` using `ggml_n_dims` function.
    - Determine the size of each element in the tensor using `ggml_element_size`.
    - Resize the `dims` and `strides` vectors to accommodate `ndims` elements.
    - Iterate over each dimension index `i` from 0 to `ndims - 1`.
    - For each dimension, set `dims[i]` to the size of the dimension `tensor->ne[i]`.
    - For each dimension, calculate the stride by dividing `tensor->nb[i]` by `element_size` and store it in `strides[i]`.
    - Return the number of dimensions `ndims`.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer representing the number of dimensions (`ndims`) of the `ggml_tensor`.


---
### ggml\_type\_to\_mudnn\_type
The function `ggml_type_to_mudnn_type` converts a `ggml_type` to a corresponding `mudnn::Tensor::Type`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `type`: A `ggml_type` value representing the type of a tensor in the GGML library.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses a switch statement to determine the corresponding `mudnn::Tensor::Type` based on the input `ggml_type`.
    - If the input type is `GGML_TYPE_F32`, it returns `mudnn::Tensor::Type::FLOAT`.
    - If the input type is `GGML_TYPE_F16`, it returns `mudnn::Tensor::Type::HALF`.
    - For any other type, it triggers an error check with `MUDNN_CHECK` using `mudnn::Status::NOT_SUPPORTED`.
    - The function defaults to returning `mudnn::Tensor::Type::FLOAT` as a fallback.
- **Output**: The function returns a `mudnn::Tensor::Type` corresponding to the input `ggml_type`, or defaults to `mudnn::Tensor::Type::FLOAT` if the type is not supported.


---
### mudnnMemcpyAsync
The `mudnnMemcpyAsync` function performs an asynchronous memory copy operation between two ggml_tensor objects using the mudnn library.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A reference to a `ggml_backend_cuda_context` object that provides the CUDA context, including the device and stream information.
    - `dst`: A pointer to a `ggml_tensor` object representing the destination tensor for the memory copy.
    - `src`: A pointer to a `ggml_tensor` object representing the source tensor for the memory copy.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `mudnn::Tensor` objects `tensor_dst` and `tensor_src` for the destination and source tensors respectively.
    - Set the data type of `tensor_dst` and `tensor_src` using `ggml_type_to_mudnn_type` based on the types of `dst` and `src`.
    - Extract dimensions and strides from the source tensor using `get_ggml_dims_and_strides` and store them in `dims` and `strides` vectors.
    - Set the number of dimensions, dimensions, and strides for both `tensor_dst` and `tensor_src` using `SetNdInfo`.
    - Set the memory addresses for `tensor_dst` and `tensor_src` using `SetAddr`.
    - Initialize a `mudnn::Unary` operation and set its mode to `IDENTITY`, with alpha and beta parameters set to 0.0.
    - Retrieve a cached `mudnn::Handle` for the current device using `get_cached_handle`.
    - Set the CUDA stream for the handle using `SetStream` with the stream from `ctx`.
    - Execute the unary operation using `op.Run` with the handle, destination tensor, and source tensor.
    - Return `musaSuccess` to indicate successful completion of the memory copy operation.
- **Output**: Returns `musaSuccess` to indicate the successful execution of the asynchronous memory copy operation.
