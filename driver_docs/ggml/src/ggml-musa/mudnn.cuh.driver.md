# Purpose
This code is a header file that provides a narrow functionality focused on asynchronous data transfer between tensors in a CUDA context. It includes necessary dependencies for CUDA operations and defines a single function, `mudnnMemcpyAsync`, which is responsible for copying data from a source tensor to a destination tensor using a specified CUDA context. The function returns a `musaError_t` type, which indicates whether the operation was successful or if it encountered an error. This file is likely intended to be included in other parts of a larger software project that involves GPU-accelerated computations, particularly those using the GGML library and CUDA for tensor operations.
