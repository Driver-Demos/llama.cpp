# Purpose
This C++ source code file is part of a library that facilitates tensor operations, specifically focusing on the integration with the ACL (Arm Compute Library) for handling tensor data types and broadcasting operations. The file provides a set of functions that map custom tensor data types to ACL data types, create ACL tensor objects from existing tensor structures, and determine the need for and compute the shapes required for broadcasting operations. The primary functions include [`ggml_cann_type_mapping`](#ggml_cann_type_mapping), which maps custom tensor types to ACL-compatible types, and [`ggml_cann_create_tensor`](#ggml_cann_create_tensor), which constructs an ACL tensor from a given tensor, handling dimensions and strides appropriately. Additionally, the file includes functions like [`ggml_cann_need_bcast`](#ggml_cann_need_bcast) and [`ggml_cann_get_bcast_shape`](#ggml_cann_get_bcast_shape) to assess and compute the necessary shapes for broadcasting operations, which are essential for performing element-wise operations on tensors of different shapes.

The code is designed to be part of a larger system, likely a machine learning or numerical computation library, where tensor operations are a core component. It does not define a standalone executable but rather provides utility functions that can be used by other parts of the system to facilitate tensor manipulation and integration with the ACL. The functions are focused on ensuring compatibility and efficient operation with the ACL, which suggests that the library is intended to leverage hardware acceleration provided by ARM architectures. The file does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly but rather serves as an internal component that supports higher-level operations within the library.

# Functions

---
### ggml\_cann\_type\_mapping<!-- {{#callable:ggml_cann_type_mapping}} -->
The function `ggml_cann_type_mapping` maps a `ggml_type` to its corresponding `aclDataType`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `type`: A `ggml_type` enumeration value representing the data type to be mapped.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses a switch statement to determine the corresponding `aclDataType` for the given `ggml_type`.
    - For each case in the switch statement, a specific `aclDataType` is returned based on the input `ggml_type`.
    - If the input `ggml_type` does not match any of the predefined cases, the function returns `ACL_DT_UNDEFINED`.
- **Output**: The function returns an `aclDataType` that corresponds to the input `ggml_type`, or `ACL_DT_UNDEFINED` if no match is found.


---
### ggml\_cann\_create\_tensor<!-- {{#callable:ggml_cann_create_tensor}} -->
The function `ggml_cann_create_tensor` creates an ACL tensor from a given ggml tensor, with optional broadcasting and custom dimensions, strides, format, and offset.
- **Inputs**:
    - `tensor`: A pointer to a `ggml_tensor` structure, which contains the original tensor data and metadata.
    - `ne`: A pointer to an array of int64_t representing the number of elements in each dimension; if null, the dimensions from the input tensor are used.
    - `nb`: A pointer to an array of size_t representing the number of bytes in each dimension; used for stride calculation if `ne` is not null.
    - `dims`: An int64_t representing the number of dimensions to consider; if zero, defaults to `GGML_MAX_DIMS`.
    - `format`: An `aclFormat` value specifying the desired format of the ACL tensor.
    - `offset`: A size_t representing the offset in bytes from the start of the data buffer.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize arrays `acl_ne` and `acl_stride` to store dimensions and strides for the ACL tensor.
    - If `ne` is null, copy dimensions and calculate strides from the input tensor; otherwise, use provided `ne` and `nb` to set dimensions and calculate strides.
    - Determine `final_dims` as either the provided `dims` or `GGML_MAX_DIMS` if `dims` is zero.
    - Calculate `acl_storage_len` as the total storage length required for the ACL tensor based on dimensions and strides.
    - Reverse the order of `acl_ne` and `acl_stride` arrays to match ACL's expected format.
    - Create an ACL tensor using `aclCreateTensor` with the calculated dimensions, strides, and other parameters.
    - Return the created ACL tensor.
- **Output**: A pointer to an `aclTensor` structure, representing the newly created ACL tensor.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`ggml_cann_type_mapping`](#ggml_cann_type_mapping)

### ggml\_cann\_need\_bcast<!-- {{#callable:ggml_cann_need_bcast}} -->
The function `ggml_cann_need_bcast` determines if broadcasting is needed between two tensors based on their dimensions.
- **Inputs**:
    - `t0`: A pointer to the first `ggml_tensor` object, representing one of the tensors to compare.
    - `t1`: A pointer to the second `ggml_tensor` object, representing the other tensor to compare.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Iterate over each dimension index from 0 to `GGML_MAX_DIMS - 1`.
    - For each dimension, check if the size of the dimension in `t1` is not equal to the size in `t0` and is not equal to 1.
    - If such a dimension is found, return `true`, indicating that broadcasting is needed.
    - If no such dimension is found after checking all dimensions, return `false`.
- **Output**: A boolean value indicating whether broadcasting is needed (`true`) or not (`false`).

### ggml\_cann\_get\_bcast\_shape<!-- {{#callable:ggml_cann_get_bcast_shape}} -->
The function `ggml_cann_get_bcast_shape` calculates the broadcast shape and strides for two tensors, `src0` and `src1`, ensuring they can be broadcasted together.
- **Inputs**:
    - `src0`: A pointer to the first `ggml_tensor` structure, representing the primary tensor for broadcasting.
    - `src1`: A pointer to the second `ggml_tensor` structure, representing the secondary tensor to be broadcasted to match `src0`.
    - `bcast_src0_ne`: A pointer to an array where the function will store the broadcasted shape of `src0`.
    - `bcast_src1_ne`: A pointer to an array where the function will store the broadcasted shape of `src1`.
    - `bcast_src0_nb`: A pointer to an array where the function will store the broadcasted strides of `src0`.
    - `bcast_src1_nb`: A pointer to an array where the function will store the broadcasted strides of `src1`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Assert that `src1` can be repeated to match `src0` using `ggml_can_repeat` function.
    - Initialize a counter `bcast_dim_cnt` to track the number of broadcast dimensions.
    - Iterate over each dimension up to `GGML_MAX_DIMS`.
    - For each dimension, calculate the ratio `nr` of `src0`'s size to `src1`'s size.
    - Store the broadcasted shape and strides for both `src0` and `src1` in the respective arrays.
    - If `nr` is not 1, add an extra dimension to the broadcasted shape and strides, incrementing `bcast_dim_cnt` accordingly.
    - Return the total count of broadcast dimensions `bcast_dim_cnt`.
- **Output**: The function returns an `int64_t` representing the number of broadcast dimensions calculated.

- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by asserting that the input and destination tensors have the same shape for dimensions 2 and 3.
    - It initializes a counter `bcast_dim_cnt` to track the number of broadcasted dimensions.
    - The function iterates over each dimension up to `GGML_MAX_DIMS`.
    - For each dimension, it calculates the ratio `nr` of the input shape to the weight shape.
    - If the dimension is less than 2 or `nr` is 1, it copies the shapes and strides directly to the broadcasted arrays and increments `bcast_dim_cnt`.
    - If `nr` is not 1, it adds an extra dimension to the broadcasted arrays, setting the weight shape to 1 and adjusting the strides accordingly.
    - The function continues to fill the broadcasted arrays with the adjusted shapes and strides, incrementing `bcast_dim_cnt` for each new dimension added.
    - Finally, it returns the total count of broadcasted dimensions, `bcast_dim_cnt`.
- **Output**: The function returns an int64_t representing the number of broadcasted dimensions.
