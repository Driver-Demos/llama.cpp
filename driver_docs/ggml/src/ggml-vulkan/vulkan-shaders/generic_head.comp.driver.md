# Purpose
This code is a shader file, likely written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language), which is used for graphics programming, particularly in defining how pixels and vertices are processed in a graphics pipeline. The file provides narrow functionality, specifically defining a set of parameters that can be used within a shader program. It declares a push constant block named `parameter`, which includes two unsigned integers (`KX` and `KY`) and two floating-point numbers (`param1` and `param2`). The use of `#extension GL_EXT_shader_16bit_storage : require` indicates that this shader requires the `GL_EXT_shader_16bit_storage` extension, which allows for more efficient storage of 16-bit data types, enhancing performance and memory usage in graphics applications. This file is intended to be part of a larger graphics application, where it would be compiled and executed on the GPU to control specific rendering behaviors.
