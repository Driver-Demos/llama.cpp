# Purpose
This source code is a GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) compute shader designed to perform matrix-vector multiplication using a specialized approach that involves processing data in blocks or "superblocks." The shader is written for the OpenGL 4.5 version and utilizes the `GL_EXT_shader_explicit_arithmetic_types_int32` extension, which allows for explicit handling of 32-bit integer arithmetic types. The code is structured to be executed on the GPU, leveraging parallel processing capabilities to efficiently handle large-scale computations.

The shader defines two main functions, `calc_superblock` and `compute_outputs`, which are responsible for the core computational tasks. The `calc_superblock` function processes a block of data, performing arithmetic operations on matrix and vector elements, and accumulates results in a temporary buffer. It uses bit manipulation and floating-point arithmetic to handle data efficiently, with a focus on optimizing performance through loop unrolling and parallel execution. The `compute_outputs` function orchestrates the overall computation by initializing temporary storage, determining workgroup and thread configurations, and invoking `calc_superblock` for each block of data. It also calls `reduce_result` to finalize the computation and store the results.

The `main` function serves as the entry point for the shader, setting up the initial conditions and determining the range of rows to process based on the workgroup and grid dimensions. It ensures that the computation is performed in chunks of `NUM_ROWS`, handling any remaining rows as needed. This shader is part of a larger system that likely involves multiple shaders and host-side code to manage data transfer and execution on the GPU, providing a specialized solution for high-performance matrix-vector multiplication tasks.
# Functions

---
### calc\_superblock
The `calc_superblock` function computes a matrix multiplication operation on a subset of data blocks, updating a temporary storage array with the results.
- **Inputs**:
    - `a_offset`: The offset in the data array 'data_a' for accessing the starting block of data.
    - `b_offset`: The offset in the data array 'data_b_v4' for accessing the starting block of data.
    - `ib32`: An index used to access specific parts of the data within a block, particularly for extracting bits.
    - `i`: The current block index being processed within a row.
    - `num_blocks_per_row`: The number of data blocks present in each row of the matrix.
    - `first_row`: The index of the first row to be processed.
    - `num_rows`: The number of rows to be processed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the y-index using the current block index and ib32.
    - Initialize the block index 'ibi' using the given offsets and indices.
    - Iterate over each row specified by 'num_rows'.
    - For each row, extract and compute various parameters from 'data_a' such as 'd', 'qh', 'dl', and 'delta'.
    - Iterate over a fixed number of elements (4) to process sub-blocks within the current block.
    - For each sub-block, extract and compute grid values and indices from 'data_a'.
    - Iterate over each column specified by 'NUM_COLS'.
    - For each column, load two vectors 'b0' and 'b4' from 'data_b_v4'.
    - Compute a sum using fused multiply-add operations over the elements of 'b0' and 'b4' with extracted grid values and 'delta'.
    - Update the temporary storage 'temp' with the computed sum scaled by 'dl'.
    - Increment the block index 'ibi' to move to the next block in the row.
- **Output**: The function updates the global temporary array 'temp' with computed values for each column and row processed.

### compute\_outputs
The `compute_outputs` function calculates and reduces matrix superblocks for a specified range of rows using parallel processing in a compute shader.
- **Inputs**:
    - `first_row`: The index of the first row to process in the matrix.
    - `num_rows`: The number of rows to process starting from the first_row.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize offsets for matrices A, B, and D using `get_offsets` function.
    - Calculate the number of blocks per row based on the number of columns and a constant `QUANT_K`.
    - Determine the number of blocks each workgroup will process and the thread's local ID within the workgroup.
    - Initialize a temporary storage array `temp` to zero for accumulating results.
    - Iterate over blocks assigned to the current workgroup and call `calc_superblock` to compute contributions to the `temp` array.
    - Call `reduce_result` to finalize and store the computed results from `temp` into the output matrix.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies global state by writing computed results to an output matrix.

### main
The `main` function initializes shared memory and computes matrix-vector multiplication outputs for a specific range of rows, handling edge cases where the number of rows is less than the defined block size.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the starting row index `first_row` based on the work group ID and number of work groups.
    - Initialize shared memory using `init_iq_shmem` with the work group size.
    - Check if the number of rows from `first_row` to `first_row + NUM_ROWS` is within the bounds of `p.stride_d`.
    - If within bounds, call `compute_outputs` for `NUM_ROWS` rows starting from `first_row`.
    - If not within bounds, check if `first_row` is beyond `p.stride_d` and return if true.
    - Otherwise, call `compute_outputs` for the remaining rows from `first_row` to `p.stride_d`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it performs computations and updates global memory with the results of matrix-vector multiplications.
