# Purpose
This source code file is a shader program written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) that provides functionality for handling and processing various quantized data formats. The code is structured to handle different data block types, such as `q4_0`, `q4_1`, `q5_0`, `q5_1`, and `q8_0`, each of which represents a specific quantization scheme. The primary operations performed by this shader include repacking quantized data into 32-bit integer vectors and performing arithmetic operations on these data types. The code utilizes GLSL extensions for explicit arithmetic types, ensuring precise control over integer operations.

The file defines several functions, each tailored to a specific data format. The `repack` function is responsible for converting quantized data into a more usable form by loading data from memory and applying bitwise operations to extract and align the quantized values. The `mul_q8_1` function performs arithmetic operations on the quantized data, typically involving multiplication and scaling, which are essential for tasks such as data normalization or transformation in graphics processing. The code also includes conditional compilation directives to ensure that only the relevant functions and operations are compiled based on the defined data format macros.

Overall, this shader program is a specialized component designed to handle quantized data efficiently within a graphics pipeline. It provides a narrow but crucial functionality for applications that require precise manipulation of quantized data, such as machine learning inference on GPUs or advanced graphics rendering techniques. The use of GLSL extensions and conditional compilation allows the shader to be flexible and adaptable to different data formats, making it a versatile tool in the context of graphics programming.
# Functions

---
### repack
The `repack` function processes and repacks quantized data blocks into 32-bit integer vectors based on different data formats.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ib`: An unsigned integer representing the index of the data block to be processed.
    - `iqs`: An unsigned integer representing the index of the quantized segment within the data block.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function behavior is conditional on the data format defined by preprocessor directives (e.g., DATA_A_Q4_0, DATA_A_Q4_1, etc.).
    - For DATA_A_Q4_0 and DATA_A_Q5_0, the function loads two 16-bit quantized values, packs them into a 32-bit integer, and processes them to extract two 32-bit integer vectors.
    - For DATA_A_Q4_1 and DATA_A_Q5_1, the function directly loads a 32-bit quantized value, processes it, and extracts two 32-bit integer vectors.
    - For DATA_A_Q5_0 and DATA_A_Q5_1, additional processing is done using high bits from a separate quantized high data source.
    - For DATA_A_Q8_0, the function loads two 16-bit quantized values and packs them into a single 32-bit integer.
- **Output**: The function returns an `i32vec2` containing two 32-bit integer vectors for most data formats, except for DATA_A_Q8_0, where it returns a single 32-bit integer.

### mul\_q8\_1
The `mul_q8_1` function performs a multiplication operation on quantized data based on the defined data type configuration.
- **Inputs**:
    - `q_sum`: An integer representing the quantized sum value.
    - `da or dma`: A float or vec2 representing a scaling factor, depending on the data type configuration.
    - `dsb`: A vec2 representing scaling factors for the quantized data.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function checks the defined data type configuration using preprocessor directives.
    - Depending on the configuration, the function performs a specific arithmetic operation involving the inputs.
    - For configurations like DATA_A_Q4_0, DATA_A_Q5_0, and DATA_A_Q8_0, the function multiplies 'da' with the product of 'q_sum' and 'dsb.x', subtracting a constant times 'dsb.y'.
    - For configurations like DATA_A_Q4_1 and DATA_A_Q5_1, the function computes a sum of products involving 'q_sum', 'dma', and 'dsb'.
- **Output**: The function returns a value of type ACC_TYPE, which is the result of the arithmetic operation based on the input parameters and the data type configuration.

### get\_d
The `get_d` function retrieves a floating-point value from a data structure based on the index provided.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ib`: An unsigned integer representing the index of the data structure from which to retrieve the floating-point value.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function checks if any of the preprocessor directives (DATA_A_Q4_0, DATA_A_Q5_0, DATA_A_Q8_0, DATA_A_IQ1_S, DATA_A_IQ2_XXS, DATA_A_IQ2_XS, DATA_A_IQ2_S, DATA_A_IQ3_XXS, DATA_A_IQ3_S, DATA_A_IQ4_XS, DATA_A_IQ4_NL) are defined.
    - If any of these directives are defined, the function retrieves the floating-point value `d` from the `data_a` array at the index `ib`.
- **Output**: A floating-point value of type `FLOAT_TYPE` from the `data_a` array at the specified index.


---
### get\_dm
The `get_dm` function retrieves a two-component floating-point vector from a packed data structure based on the given index.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ib`: An unsigned integer representing the index of the data block from which to retrieve the floating-point vector.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function checks if the preprocessor directive for `DATA_A_Q4_1` or `DATA_A_Q5_1` is defined.
    - If defined, it accesses the `dm` field from the `data_a_packed32` array at the specified index `ib`.
    - The function returns the `dm` field as a `FLOAT_TYPE_VEC2`.
- **Output**: A `FLOAT_TYPE_VEC2` representing a two-component floating-point vector from the specified data block.
