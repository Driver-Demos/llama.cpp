# Purpose
This code is a GLSL compute shader designed for performing pooling operations on a set of input data, typically used in the context of neural networks or image processing tasks. The shader is written in GLSL version 450 and utilizes the `GL_EXT_shader_16bit_storage` extension, which allows for efficient storage and manipulation of 16-bit data types. The shader is structured to handle two types of pooling operations: maximum pooling and average pooling, as indicated by the defined constants `OP_POOL_MAX` and `OP_POOL_AVG`.

The shader operates on data stored in two buffer objects: a read-only buffer `X` containing the input data (`data_a`) and a write-only buffer `D` for the output data (`data_d`). The layout of the compute shader specifies a local workgroup size of 512 threads along the x-axis, which is optimized for parallel processing of the data elements. The shader uses a set of parameters defined in a push constant block, which includes dimensions of the input and output data, kernel size, stride, padding, and the operation type. These parameters allow the shader to be flexible and adaptable to different pooling configurations.

The main function of the shader calculates the output value for each element by iterating over the relevant input data region, determined by the kernel size and stride, and applying the specified pooling operation. For average pooling, it computes the mean of the input values, while for maximum pooling, it selects the maximum value. The result is then stored in the output buffer. This shader is a specialized component within a larger graphics or compute pipeline, providing efficient data reduction capabilities essential for tasks like downsampling in convolutional neural networks.
# Global Variables

---
### BLOCK\_SIZE
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: BLOCK_SIZE is a global constant defined with a value of 512. It is used to specify the size of the work group in the compute shader, particularly the number of threads in the x-dimension of the local work group.
- **Use**: BLOCK_SIZE is used to define the local work group size in the compute shader, influencing parallel execution.


---
### FLT\_MAX
- **Type**: `float`
- **Description**: `FLT_MAX` is a macro that defines the maximum representable finite floating-point number in the shader, which is approximately 3.402823466e+38F. It is used to initialize variables that will store the maximum value found in a set of floating-point numbers.
- **Use**: `FLT_MAX` is used to initialize the `res` variable to a very large negative value when performing a max pooling operation, ensuring that any real number will be larger than this initial value.


---
### OP\_POOL\_MAX
- **Type**: `unsigned integer`
- **Description**: `OP_POOL_MAX` is a global constant defined as an unsigned integer with a value of 0. It is used to represent the operation type for maximum pooling in a shader program.
- **Use**: This variable is used to determine if the pooling operation should perform a maximum pooling operation by comparing it with the `op` field in the push constant `p`.


---
### OP\_POOL\_AVG
- **Type**: `unsigned integer`
- **Description**: `OP_POOL_AVG` is a global constant defined as an unsigned integer with a value of 1. It is used to specify the operation type for average pooling in a shader program.
- **Use**: This variable is used to determine if the average pooling operation should be performed within the shader's main function.


# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function performs either average or max pooling on input data based on specified parameters and writes the result to an output buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A push constant block containing parameters such as input and output dimensions, operation type, kernel size, stride, and padding.
    - `data_a`: A read-only buffer containing the input data of type `A_TYPE`.
    - `data_d`: A write-only buffer where the output data of type `D_TYPE` will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the global invocation index `idx` and return if it exceeds the number of processing elements `p.pelements`.
    - Compute the output height-width product `O_HW` and derive the current output channel, height, and width indices.
    - Calculate the starting and ending indices for the height and width based on stride and padding, ensuring they are within input bounds.
    - Initialize the result `res` to 0 for average pooling or negative infinity for max pooling, based on the operation type `p.op`.
    - Iterate over the input data within the calculated height and width bounds, updating `res` by either accumulating scaled values for average pooling or finding the maximum value for max pooling.
    - Store the computed result `res` in the output buffer `data_d` at the appropriate index.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but writes the computed pooling result to the `data_d` buffer at the calculated index.
