# Purpose
This code is a compute shader written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) version 450, designed to perform parallel computations on the GPU. The shader is structured to handle matrix or tensor operations, as indicated by the use of buffers A, B, and D, which are bound to specific indices and represent input and output data. The shader utilizes a local workgroup size of 128, which suggests that it is optimized for parallel execution, leveraging the GPU's architecture to efficiently process large datasets.

The primary functionality of this shader is to perform a series of computations involving the multiplication and accumulation of elements from the input buffers A and B, storing the results in the output buffer D. The shader uses shared memory to temporarily store intermediate results, which are then processed in blocks. The use of barriers ensures synchronization between different threads within a workgroup, allowing for coordinated data processing. The shader's logic includes loops that iterate over blocks of data, applying operations such as fused multiply-add (FMA) to compute the desired results.

The shader defines a set of parameters using a push constant block, which includes dimensions and other configuration variables necessary for the computation. These parameters allow the shader to be flexible and adaptable to different input sizes and configurations. The code is structured to handle edge cases, such as varying block sizes, ensuring that the computations are correctly applied across the entire dataset. Overall, this shader is a specialized component intended for high-performance computing tasks, particularly those involving linear algebra operations on large matrices or tensors.
# Global Variables

---
### Cout\_idx
- **Type**: `uint32_t`
- **Description**: `Cout_idx` is a global variable of type `uint32_t` that represents the index of the current output channel being processed in a compute shader. It is initialized with the value of `gl_WorkGroupID.x`, which is the x-coordinate of the workgroup within the dispatch grid.
- **Use**: This variable is used to index into the output buffer `data_d` and the kernel buffer `data_a` to process and store results for a specific output channel.


---
### bs
- **Type**: `uint32_t`
- **Description**: The variable `bs` is a constant unsigned 32-bit integer that represents the size of the work group in the x-dimension for the compute shader. It is derived from the built-in variable `gl_WorkGroupSize.x`, which specifies the number of work items in a work group along the x-axis.
- **Use**: `bs` is used to determine the number of work items in a work group and to calculate indices and offsets for parallel processing within the shader.


---
### tid
- **Type**: `uint32_t`
- **Description**: The `tid` variable is a global variable representing the local invocation index within a workgroup in a compute shader. It is derived from `gl_LocalInvocationID.x`, which provides the index of the current invocation within the local workgroup along the x-axis. This variable is used to uniquely identify each thread within a workgroup, allowing for parallel processing of data.
- **Use**: `tid` is used to index into shared memory and perform operations specific to each thread within a workgroup.


---
### tmp\_len
- **Type**: `uint32_t`
- **Description**: The `tmp_len` variable is a global constant that calculates the length of the temporary shared memory buffer `tmp` used in the shader. It is computed as the product of the local workgroup size `bs` and the stride `p.s0`, plus the kernel size `p.K`. This calculation ensures that the buffer is large enough to accommodate the data processed by each workgroup.
- **Use**: `tmp_len` is used to determine the bounds for initializing and processing the shared memory buffer `tmp` within the compute shader.


---
### tmp
- **Type**: `shared D_TYPE[4096]`
- **Description**: The `tmp` variable is a shared memory array of type `D_TYPE` with a fixed size of 4096 elements. It is used within the compute shader to temporarily store intermediate results during the computation process. The shared memory allows for efficient data exchange between work items within the same workgroup.
- **Use**: `tmp` is used to store intermediate results of computations and facilitate data sharing among work items in a workgroup.


# Functions

---
### splitWork
The `splitWork` function calculates the number of work groups needed to process a given workload size based on the local work group size.
- **Inputs**:
    - `workSize`: The total size of the workload that needs to be processed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes the total workload size (`workSize`) and adds the local work group size (`bs`) minus one to it.
    - It then divides the result by the local work group size (`bs`) to determine the number of work groups needed.
    - The division is performed using integer arithmetic, effectively rounding up to ensure all work is covered.
- **Output**: The function returns an unsigned integer representing the number of work groups required to process the given workload size.


---
### main
The `main` function performs a parallel matrix multiplication and accumulation operation using GPU compute shaders, storing the result in a buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data_a`: A read-only buffer containing the kernel matrix with dimensions [K, Cout, Cin].
    - `data_b`: A read-only buffer containing the input matrix with dimensions [L, Cin].
    - `data_d`: A write-only buffer where the result matrix with dimensions [KL, Cout] will be stored.
    - `p`: A uniform parameter structure containing various dimensions and constants used in the computation, such as Cout, Cin, K, L, KL, nb01, nb02, nb11, nb1, and s0.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a shared temporary buffer `tmp` to zero using a loop over `splitWork(tmp_len)`.
    - Iterate over blocks of L (`L_blocks`) and perform a barrier synchronization at the start of each block iteration.
    - Shift values in `tmp` to the current processing window if not the first block, and reset the rest to zero.
    - For each block, compute contributions to `tmp` by iterating over K and Cin dimensions, using fused multiply-add (fma) operations with elements from `data_a` and `data_b`.
    - Store computed values from `tmp` to `data_d` for all blocks except the last one, which may have a different size.
    - In a final loop, store remaining computed values from `tmp` to `data_d` for the last block.
- **Output**: The function writes the result of the matrix multiplication and accumulation to the `data_d` buffer.
