# Purpose
This code is a GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) compute shader designed to perform a softmax operation on input data. The shader is written for the Vulkan API, as indicated by the `#version 450` directive, which specifies the GLSL version compatible with Vulkan. The shader utilizes push constants to pass parameters such as dimensions (`KX`, `KY`), scaling factors (`scale`, `max_bias`), and other configuration values (`m0`, `m1`, `n_head_log2`, `nrows_x`) to the GPU. These parameters are used to control the behavior of the softmax computation, including the handling of multiple heads in a multi-head attention mechanism, as suggested by the ALiBi (Attention with Linear Biases) implementation.

The shader reads input data from two buffers, `X` and `Y`, and writes the results to a third buffer, `D`. The `soft_max` function is the core of the shader, performing the softmax operation by first computing the maximum value across a set of data points, then calculating the exponentials of the differences between each data point and the maximum value, and finally normalizing these exponentials to produce the softmax output. The shader uses shared memory (`vals`) to facilitate efficient reduction operations across workgroups, which are essential for parallel processing on the GPU.

The `main` function orchestrates the execution of the `soft_max` function by determining the number of iterations required based on the input size (`KX`) and the block size (`BLOCK_SIZE`). It instantiates the `soft_max` function with different loop unrolling configurations to optimize performance for various input sizes. This shader is a specialized component intended for use in machine learning or graphics applications where efficient computation of the softmax function is required, particularly in scenarios involving large datasets or real-time processing.
# Global Variables

---
### BLOCK\_SIZE
- **Type**: `uint`
- **Description**: BLOCK_SIZE is a constant unsigned integer that defines the size of a block used in the compute shader. It is set to 32, which is a common size for workgroup operations in GPU programming, allowing for efficient parallel processing.
- **Use**: BLOCK_SIZE is used to determine the number of iterations and the size of shared memory arrays in the shader's parallel computations.


# Functions

---
### soft\_max
The `soft_max` function computes the softmax operation over a set of input data, applying scaling and bias adjustments, and stores the results in an output buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `num_iters`: The number of iterations, each of size BLOCK_SIZE, required to process all columns of the input data.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize thread and row indices based on the workgroup and local invocation IDs.
    - Check if the current row index exceeds the number of rows to process; if so, exit the function early.
    - Calculate a slope value based on the head index and bias parameters if max_bias is greater than zero.
    - Initialize a variable to store the maximum value found in the data, starting with the smallest possible float value.
    - Iterate over the columns in blocks of size BLOCK_SIZE, computing a scaled and biased value for each element and updating the maximum value found.
    - Store computed values in a cache for later use, if within cache size limits.
    - Perform a reduction across the workgroup to find the maximum value of all elements processed by the workgroup.
    - Compute the sum of exponentials of the adjusted values, using cached values where possible, and store results in the output buffer.
    - Perform a reduction across the workgroup to compute the total sum of exponentials.
    - Calculate the reciprocal of the sum and use it to normalize the cached values, storing the final softmax results in the output buffer.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but writes the computed softmax results to the output buffer `data_d`.

### main
The `main` function determines the number of iterations needed for the `soft_max` function based on the size of the data and invokes `soft_max` with an appropriate number of iterations to optimize loop unrolling.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the number of blocks needed by dividing `p.KX` by `BLOCK_SIZE` and rounding up.
    - Check the number of blocks and call `soft_max` with a specific number of iterations to allow for loop unrolling, choosing from 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 16, or 32 iterations based on the number of blocks.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it orchestrates the execution of the `soft_max` function with optimized loop unrolling.
