# Purpose
This code is a GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) shader file, specifically a fragment or vertex shader, as indicated by the `#version 460` directive, which specifies the GLSL version being used. The presence of `#extension GL_KHR_cooperative_matrix : require` suggests that this shader is intended to leverage the cooperative matrix extension, which is used for advanced matrix operations, often in the context of high-performance graphics or compute tasks. The `void main()` function is the entry point for the shader, but it is currently empty, indicating that this file serves as a template or starting point for further development. The functionality provided by this file is narrow, as it is designed to be part of a larger graphics pipeline, typically used in rendering processes within a graphics application or game engine.
# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function is an empty entry point for a GLSL shader program.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined with the `void` return type, indicating it does not return any value.
    - The function body is empty, meaning it performs no operations or logic.
- **Output**: The function does not produce any output.
