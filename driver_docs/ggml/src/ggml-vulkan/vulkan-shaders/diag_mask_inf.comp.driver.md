# Purpose
This code is a GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) compute shader, which is designed to perform parallel computations on the GPU. The shader is written for version 450 of GLSL and utilizes specific extensions for 16-bit storage and control flow attributes, indicating its use in advanced graphics or compute operations. The primary purpose of this shader is to process data stored in buffers, specifically reading from a buffer `X` and writing to a buffer `D`. The shader operates on a grid of threads defined by `local_size_x`, `local_size_y`, and `local_size_z`, which in this case is set to process data in a 2D grid with a significant number of threads along the y-axis.

The shader uses a push constant block to receive parameters such as `ncols`, `rows_per_channel`, and `n_past`, which control the logic of data processing. The main function calculates indices based on the global invocation ID, which determines the specific thread's position in the grid. The shader checks conditions based on these parameters to decide whether to write a default value (represented by `uintBitsToFloat(0xFF800000)`, which is a special floating-point value) or to copy data from the input buffer `X` to the output buffer `D`. This logic suggests that the shader is used for filtering or transforming data based on certain criteria, likely in a graphics or data processing pipeline.

The inclusion of `types.comp` suggests that the shader relies on external type definitions, which are crucial for interpreting the data in the buffers. The use of `A_TYPE` and `D_TYPE` indicates that the shader is designed to be flexible with the types of data it processes, allowing for different data formats to be used without modifying the core logic. This shader is a specialized component within a larger system, likely part of a graphics application or a compute-intensive task, where it performs specific data manipulation tasks efficiently on the GPU.
# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function processes a 2D grid of data, writing transformed or copied values from a read-only buffer to a write-only buffer based on specific conditions.
- **Inputs**:
    - `gl_GlobalInvocationID`: A built-in variable that provides the global invocation ID for the current shader execution, used to determine the current column and row being processed.
    - `p`: A push constant uniform block containing three unsigned integers: `ncols` (number of columns), `rows_per_channel` (number of rows per channel), and `n_past` (a threshold value for past columns).
    - `data_a`: A read-only buffer of type `A_TYPE` containing the input data to be processed.
    - `data_d`: A write-only buffer of type `D_TYPE` where the processed data will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the current column (`col`) and row (`row`) from `gl_GlobalInvocationID`.
    - Check if the current column (`col`) is greater than or equal to `p.ncols`; if true, exit the function early.
    - Calculate the linear index `i` using the formula `row*p.ncols + col`.
    - Check if the current column (`col`) is greater than `p.n_past + row % p.rows_per_channel`; if true, set `data_d[i]` to a special floating-point value representing negative infinity.
    - If the above condition is false, copy the value from `data_a[i]` to `data_d[i]`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but writes processed data to the `data_d` buffer based on the conditions evaluated.
