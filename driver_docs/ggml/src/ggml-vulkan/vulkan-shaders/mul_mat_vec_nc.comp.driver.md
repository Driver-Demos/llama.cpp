# Purpose
This code is a GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) compute shader designed to perform parallel computations on the GPU. The shader is structured to handle matrix or vector operations, leveraging the GPU's parallel processing capabilities to efficiently compute results. The shader uses several OpenGL extensions to enhance its functionality, such as `GL_EXT_control_flow_attributes` and `GL_EXT_shader_16bit_storage`, which enable advanced control flow and storage capabilities, respectively.

The shader defines several buffer layouts for reading and writing data, indicating that it processes input data from buffers `A` and `B` and writes results to buffer `D`. It also uses vectorized data types (`vec4`) for optimized data access and computation, particularly when the data is aligned. The shader employs a block size of 32 for its local workgroup size, which is a common choice for balancing workload distribution across GPU threads. The use of shared memory (`shared FLOAT_TYPE tmp[BLOCK_SIZE]`) allows for efficient accumulation of partial results within a workgroup before writing the final result to the output buffer.

The main function of the shader is to compute dot products between vectors from the input buffers, using a combination of scalar and vectorized operations depending on data alignment. It includes logic for unrolling loops to enhance performance when conditions allow, and it uses barriers to synchronize threads within a workgroup. The shader's design is optimized for scenarios where large-scale data processing is required, such as in graphics rendering or scientific computations, where leveraging the parallel nature of GPUs can significantly accelerate processing times.
# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function performs parallel matrix-vector multiplication using GPU shaders, optimizing for vectorized operations and shared memory usage.
- **Inputs**:
    - `gl_LocalInvocationID.x`: The local thread index within the workgroup, used to identify the thread's position in the block.
    - `gl_GlobalInvocationID.y`: The global row index for the current invocation, used to identify the row of the matrix being processed.
    - `gl_GlobalInvocationID.z`: The global channel index for the current invocation, used to identify the channel of the matrix being processed.
    - `data_a`: The input buffer containing matrix A data, accessed as individual elements.
    - `data_b`: The input buffer containing matrix B data, accessed as individual elements.
    - `data_a_v4`: The input buffer containing matrix A data, accessed as vec4 elements for vectorized operations.
    - `data_b_v4`: The input buffer containing matrix B data, accessed as vec4 elements for vectorized operations.
    - `dst`: The output buffer where the result of the matrix-vector multiplication is stored.
    - `p`: A structure containing various parameters such as dimensions and strides for the matrices involved in the computation.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize thread and channel indices based on invocation IDs and push constants.
    - Determine if vectorized operations can be used based on alignment conditions.
    - Iterate over columns of the matrix, performing vectorized or scalar operations based on alignment and unrolling conditions.
    - Accumulate partial results in shared memory for each thread.
    - Synchronize threads using barriers to ensure all partial results are available.
    - Perform a reduction on the partial results to compute the final result for each block.
    - Write the final result to the output buffer if the thread index is zero.
- **Output**: The function writes the result of the matrix-vector multiplication to the `dst` buffer at the calculated index.
