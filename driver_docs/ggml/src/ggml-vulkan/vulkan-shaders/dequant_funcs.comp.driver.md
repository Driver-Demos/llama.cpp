# Purpose
This source code file is a shader program written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) that provides functionality for dequantizing various types of data formats. The code is structured to handle multiple data types, such as floating-point (F32, F16, BF16) and quantized formats (Q4_0, Q4_1, Q5_0, Q5_1, Q8_0, IQ1_S, IQ1_M, IQ2_XXS, IQ2_XS, IQ2_S, IQ3_XXS, IQ3_S, IQ4_XS, IQ4_NL). Each data type has a corresponding dequantization function that converts the quantized data back into a more usable floating-point format, typically represented as `vec2` or `vec4` vectors.

The file includes conditional compilation directives to ensure that only the relevant sections of code are compiled based on the defined data type macros. This modular approach allows the shader to be flexible and adaptable to different data formats without requiring changes to the core logic. The dequantization functions utilize bit manipulation and arithmetic operations to extract and convert the quantized values, often involving bitfield extraction, unpacking, and scaling operations. The code also includes functions to retrieve additional metadata, such as scale and offset values, which are used in the dequantization process.

Overall, this shader program is a specialized component designed to handle the conversion of various quantized data formats into floating-point representations within a graphics pipeline. It is likely part of a larger system that processes and renders data, where efficient and accurate dequantization is crucial for maintaining visual fidelity and performance. The use of GLSL and the specific focus on dequantization suggest that this code is intended for use in GPU-based applications, such as real-time graphics rendering or machine learning inference on graphics hardware.

### dequantize
The `dequantize` function converts quantized data into floating-point vectors based on various data formats and configurations.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ib`: An unsigned integer representing the base index for accessing data.
    - `iqs`: An unsigned integer representing the index or shift value for quantized data.
    - `a_offset`: An unsigned integer representing the offset to be added to the base index for accessing data.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function checks for various data format definitions (e.g., DATA_A_F32, DATA_A_F16, DATA_A_BF16, etc.) to determine the appropriate dequantization logic.
    - For floating-point formats (DATA_A_F32, DATA_A_F16), it directly retrieves two consecutive data points from the data array and returns them as a vec2.
    - For bfloat16 format (DATA_A_BF16), it converts bfloat16 data to float32 before returning as a vec2.
    - For quantized formats (e.g., DATA_A_Q4_0, DATA_A_Q4_1, DATA_A_Q5_0, etc.), it extracts quantized values, applies bitwise operations to retrieve individual components, and adjusts them using specific offsets or scales before returning as a vec2 or vec4.
    - The function uses bitfield extraction, bitwise operations, and conditional logic to handle different quantization schemes and data packing formats.
- **Output**: The function returns a vec2 or vec4 containing dequantized floating-point values derived from the input quantized data.

### dequantize4
The `dequantize4` function extracts and processes quantized data from a packed buffer to return a four-component vector, applying specific transformations based on the data type configuration.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ib`: An unsigned integer representing the base index for accessing the data buffer.
    - `iqs`: An unsigned integer representing the index within the quantized data structure.
    - `a_offset`: An unsigned integer representing the offset to be added to the base index for accessing the data buffer.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function first calculates the unsigned integer `vui` by accessing the `qs` field of the `data_a_packed16` buffer at the position determined by `a_offset + ib` and `iqs/2`.
    - Depending on the data type configuration (e.g., `DATA_A_Q4_0`, `DATA_A_Q4_1`, `DATA_A_Q5_0`, etc.), the function applies different bitwise operations to extract four components from `vui`.
    - For `DATA_A_Q4_0`, the function extracts four 4-bit components from `vui`, shifts them, and subtracts 8.0 from each to form a `vec4`.
    - For `DATA_A_Q4_1`, the function extracts four 4-bit components from `vui` without any subtraction.
    - For `DATA_A_Q5_0`, the function combines additional high bits from `qh` to the extracted components and subtracts 16.0 from each.
    - For `DATA_A_Q5_1`, the function similarly combines high bits from `qh` to the extracted components without subtraction.
    - For `DATA_A_Q8_0`, the function unpacks two 8-bit components from each of two 16-bit integers to form a `vec4`.
    - For `DATA_A_IQ1_S`, `DATA_A_IQ1_M`, `DATA_A_IQ2_XXS`, `DATA_A_IQ2_XS`, `DATA_A_IQ2_S`, `DATA_A_IQ3_XXS`, `DATA_A_IQ3_S`, `DATA_A_IQ4_XS`, and `DATA_A_IQ4_NL`, the function applies specific transformations involving scales, signs, and grid values to compute the final `vec4`.
- **Output**: A `vec4` representing the dequantized values extracted and processed from the packed data buffer.

### get\_dm
The `get_dm` function retrieves a two-component vector based on the data type configuration, extracting specific values from a data buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ib`: An unsigned integer representing the index or offset within the data buffer.
    - `a_offset`: An unsigned integer representing an additional offset to be added to the base index for accessing the data buffer.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function checks for various preprocessor directives to determine the data type configuration.
    - For `DATA_A_F32`, `DATA_A_F16`, or `DATA_A_BF16`, it returns a zero vector `vec2(0, 0)`.
    - For `DATA_A_IQ1_M`, it extracts scale values, shifts them, and unpacks them to compute a float `d`, returning `vec2(d, 0)`.
    - For `DATA_A_Q4_0`, `DATA_A_Q5_0`, `DATA_A_Q8_0`, `DATA_A_IQ1_S`, `DATA_A_IQ2_XXS`, `DATA_A_IQ2_XS`, `DATA_A_IQ2_S`, `DATA_A_IQ3_XXS`, `DATA_A_IQ3_S`, `DATA_A_IQ4_XS`, or `DATA_A_IQ4_NL`, it retrieves a float `d` from the data buffer and returns `vec2(d, 0)`.
    - For `DATA_A_Q4_1` or `DATA_A_Q5_1`, it retrieves two floats `d` and `m` from the data buffer and returns `vec2(d, m)`.
- **Output**: A `vec2` object containing two float components, which are determined based on the data type configuration and extracted from the data buffer.
