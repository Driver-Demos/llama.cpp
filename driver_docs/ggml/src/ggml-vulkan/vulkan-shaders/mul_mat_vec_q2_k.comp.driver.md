# Purpose
This source code is a GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) compute shader designed to perform matrix-vector multiplication operations. The shader is written for the OpenGL 4.5 version and utilizes the `GL_EXT_shader_explicit_arithmetic_types_int32` extension to handle explicit 32-bit integer arithmetic types. The code is structured to execute on the GPU, leveraging parallel processing capabilities to efficiently handle large-scale computations. The shader is intended to be part of a larger graphics or compute pipeline, where it is likely invoked to perform high-performance mathematical operations on matrices and vectors, which are common in graphics rendering and scientific computations.

The shader defines a function `calc_superblock` that processes blocks of data, performing arithmetic operations on matrix and vector elements. It uses shared memory to cache intermediate results, which helps in reducing the number of memory accesses and thus improves performance. The function utilizes bitwise operations and vectorized arithmetic to efficiently compute results, which are then stored in a temporary array. The `compute_outputs` function orchestrates the computation by determining offsets and iterating over data blocks, invoking `calc_superblock` to perform the necessary calculations. The `main` function serves as the entry point, determining the range of rows to process and calling `compute_outputs` accordingly.

Overall, this shader file provides specialized functionality for matrix-vector multiplication, optimized for execution on a GPU. It is a focused piece of code that fits into a broader system, likely as part of a graphics application or a scientific computing framework. The use of shared memory, bitwise operations, and vectorized arithmetic highlights its design for high-performance computing tasks.
# Global Variables

---
### temp
- **Type**: `FLOAT_TYPE[][]`
- **Description**: The `temp` variable is a two-dimensional array of type `FLOAT_TYPE` with dimensions `NUM_COLS` by `NUM_ROWS`. It is used to store intermediate results during the computation of matrix operations in the shader program.
- **Use**: `temp` is used to accumulate and store the results of matrix-vector multiplications and other arithmetic operations within the `calc_superblock` and `compute_outputs` functions.


---
### csel
- **Type**: `uint`
- **Description**: The `csel` variable is a global unsigned integer used to toggle between two states, typically 0 and 1, during the execution of the shader program. It is used to select between two shared memory caches, `sccache1` and `sccache2`, for storing intermediate computation results.
- **Use**: `csel` is used within the `calc_superblock` function to alternate between two shared caches for storing and retrieving data during matrix-vector multiplication operations.


# Functions

---
### calc\_superblock
The `calc_superblock` function performs matrix multiplication and accumulation for a specific block of data using shared memory and SIMD operations in a compute shader.
- **Inputs**:
    - `a_offset`: The offset in the data array for matrix A.
    - `b_offset`: The offset in the data array for matrix B.
    - `itid`: The thread index within a workgroup, ranging from 0 to 15.
    - `v_im`: A value indicating which half of the vector is being processed, either 0 or 1.
    - `ix`: The index of the current thread divided by 16.
    - `q_offset`: The offset for quantized data within a block.
    - `y_offset`: The offset for the y-dimension within a block.
    - `i`: The current block index being processed.
    - `num_blocks_per_row`: The number of blocks per row in the matrix.
    - `first_row`: The index of the first row to process.
    - `num_rows`: The number of rows to process.
    - `all_threads`: A boolean indicating whether all threads are used for processing.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the y-index using the current row index and y-offset.
    - Iterate over each row to be processed.
    - Calculate the base index for matrix A using the offset and current row index.
    - Toggle the selection index for shared cache arrays.
    - If not all threads are used, check if the current block index is within the number of blocks per row.
    - Load scale values from matrix A into shared cache arrays, using bit manipulation to separate components.
    - Synchronize threads using a barrier to ensure all threads have loaded their data.
    - If the current block index is beyond the number of blocks per row, continue to the next iteration.
    - Load quantized data from packed matrix A and unpack it into vectors using bit manipulation.
    - Load scaling factors from matrix A and convert them to floating-point values.
    - Iterate over each column to be processed.
    - Load data from matrix B using the calculated offsets and batch stride.
    - Initialize sum variables for accumulation.
    - Perform fused multiply-add operations to accumulate results using shared cache data and unpacked quantized data.
    - Store the accumulated result in a temporary array for the current column and row.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `temp` array in shared memory with the accumulated results of the matrix multiplication.

### compute\_outputs
The `compute_outputs` function calculates and reduces matrix block results for a specified range of rows using parallel processing in a GPU shader.
- **Inputs**:
    - `first_row`: The starting row index for the computation.
    - `num_rows`: The number of rows to process starting from `first_row`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize offsets for matrices A, B, and D using `get_offsets` function.
    - Calculate the number of blocks per row based on the number of columns and a quantization constant `QUANT_K`.
    - Determine the size of each thread group and calculate thread-specific indices for processing.
    - Initialize a temporary matrix `temp` to store intermediate results, setting all values to zero.
    - Calculate the number of blocks that can be processed by all threads and those that require partial threading.
    - Iterate over the blocks that can be processed by all threads, calling `calc_superblock` with `all_threads` set to true.
    - Process any remaining blocks with `calc_superblock` using partial threading by setting `all_threads` to false.
    - Reduce the results stored in `temp` using the `reduce_result` function, which writes the final output to the appropriate location.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it writes the computed results to a shared memory location or buffer, typically used for further processing or output in a GPU context.

### main
The `main` function orchestrates the computation of matrix-vector multiplication by determining the range of rows to process and invoking the `compute_outputs` function accordingly.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate `first_row` based on the work group ID and number of work groups.
    - Check if `first_row + NUM_ROWS` is within the bounds of `p.stride_d`.
    - If within bounds, call `compute_outputs` with `first_row` and `NUM_ROWS`.
    - If not within bounds, check if `first_row` is beyond `p.stride_d` and return if true.
    - Otherwise, call `compute_outputs` with `first_row` and the remaining rows to process.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it performs computations and updates shared data structures.
