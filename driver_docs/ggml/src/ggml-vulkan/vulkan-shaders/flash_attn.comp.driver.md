# Purpose
This source code is a GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) compute shader designed to perform operations related to attention mechanisms, commonly used in machine learning models, particularly in the context of neural networks for tasks like natural language processing. The shader is written for the OpenGL 4.5 version and utilizes several extensions to enhance its capabilities, such as handling 16-bit storage and explicit arithmetic types, which are crucial for optimizing performance and memory usage in GPU computations.

The shader's primary function is to compute attention scores and apply them to input data, which is a critical step in models like transformers. It reads input data from several buffers (Q, K, V, and M), which represent query, key, value, and mask matrices, respectively. The shader performs matrix multiplications and other arithmetic operations to calculate attention scores, apply masks, and compute weighted sums. It uses shared memory to optimize data access patterns and reduce latency, which is essential for high-performance GPU computations.

The code is structured to handle parallel execution across multiple threads, leveraging the GPU's architecture to perform computations efficiently. It includes mechanisms for handling different configurations, such as varying block sizes and split operations, which allow it to be flexible and adaptable to different model requirements. The shader also includes logic for handling special cases, such as applying a soft cap to logits and managing numerical stability by avoiding NaNs. Overall, this shader is a specialized component within a larger machine learning framework, focusing on the efficient computation of attention mechanisms on the GPU.
# Global Variables

---
### D\_per\_thread
- **Type**: `uint32_t`
- **Description**: `D_per_thread` is a constant unsigned 32-bit integer that represents the number of elements processed per thread in a parallel computation. It is calculated by dividing the total dimension `D` by `D_split`, which likely represents the number of splits or partitions of the dimension `D` for parallel processing.
- **Use**: This variable is used to determine the workload assigned to each thread in the shader program, specifically in the context of processing elements in parallel.

### cols\_per\_iter
- **Type**: `uint32_t`
- **Description**: The `cols_per_iter` variable is a constant unsigned 32-bit integer that represents the number of columns processed per iteration in a workgroup. It is calculated by dividing the `WorkGroupSize` by `D_split`, where `WorkGroupSize` is the total number of threads in a workgroup and `D_split` is a division factor for the data dimension `D`. This variable is used to determine how the workload is distributed across threads in a workgroup.
- **Use**: `cols_per_iter` is used to calculate the number of columns each thread processes in a workgroup iteration.

### cols\_per\_thread
- **Type**: `uint32_t`
- **Description**: The `cols_per_thread` variable is a constant unsigned 32-bit integer that represents the number of columns each thread is responsible for processing. It is calculated by dividing the total number of columns `Bc` by the number of columns processed per iteration `cols_per_iter`. This calculation ensures that the workload is evenly distributed across threads.
- **Use**: This variable is used to determine the number of columns each thread will handle during parallel processing in the shader program.

    - `c`: The column index for the operation.
    - `elem`: The element of type D_TYPE to be stored.
    - `o_offset`: The offset in the output buffer where the element should be stored.
