# Purpose
This source code file is a GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) compute shader, which is designed to perform parallel processing on the GPU. The shader is written for the OpenGL 4.5 version, as indicated by the `#version 450` directive. The primary purpose of this shader is to perform dequantization operations on data stored in a buffer, which is a common task in graphics and compute applications where data is often quantized to save space and bandwidth. The shader reads from a read-only buffer `A` and writes the processed results to a write-only buffer `D`, both of which are bound to specific binding points.

The shader is structured to execute in parallel across multiple workgroups, with each workgroup processing a segment of the data. The `layout(local_size_x = 32, local_size_y = 1, local_size_z = 1) in;` line specifies that each workgroup consists of 32 threads, which is a typical configuration for efficient execution on modern GPUs. The main function contains a loop that iterates over a range of indices, performing calculations to dequantize the data. It uses various indices and bit manipulation techniques to extract and scale the quantized values, which are then used to compute the final dequantized values stored in the output buffer.

The shader includes several technical components, such as the use of `uint8_t` for handling byte-level operations and the use of `FLOAT_TYPE` and `D_TYPE` for floating-point calculations. The code also makes use of the `[[unroll]]` directive to suggest loop unrolling to the compiler, which can improve performance by reducing the overhead of loop control. Overall, this shader is a specialized piece of code focused on efficiently transforming quantized data into a usable form for further processing or rendering.
# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function processes data from a read-only buffer, performs dequantization and scaling operations, and writes the results to a write-only buffer in a compute shader.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data_a`: A read-only buffer of type A_TYPE containing input data, including scales and quantized values.
    - `data_b`: A write-only buffer of type D_TYPE where the processed output data is stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function iterates over a loop with a fixed size of 256, calculating an index `ib` based on the work group ID and loop index `wgy`.
    - It checks if `ib` is within bounds by comparing it to a pre-calculated limit based on parameters `p.M`, `p.K`, and `QUANT_K`; if out of bounds, the function returns early.
    - For each thread, it calculates thread-specific indices `tid`, `il`, `ir`, `is`, and `n` to determine positions in the data arrays.
    - It retrieves and converts specific data values from `data_a` using these indices, including `dall` and `dmin`.
    - The function calculates indices for scales and quantized values, and extracts scale and mbyte values using bitwise operations.
    - It computes two sets of dequantized values `d1`, `m1` and `d2`, `m2` using the extracted scale and mbyte values.
    - A nested loop iterates over a fixed size `n`, performing dequantization and scaling on quantized values from `data_a`, and writes the results to `data_b`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it writes processed data to the `data_b` buffer.
