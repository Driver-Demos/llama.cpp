# Purpose
This source code is a GLSL compute shader designed for parallel processing on a GPU. It is intended to perform matrix-vector multiplication, specifically optimized for handling large datasets by dividing the workload into smaller blocks, or "superblocks," which are processed concurrently by multiple threads. The shader uses explicit arithmetic types and leverages the GPU's parallel processing capabilities to efficiently compute the results. The code includes a main function that orchestrates the computation by determining the range of data to process and invoking the `compute_outputs` function, which in turn calls `calc_superblock` to perform the actual matrix-vector multiplication.

The shader is structured to handle data in blocks, with each block processed by a group of threads. The `calc_superblock` function is the core computational component, where it iterates over rows and columns of the matrix, applying a series of fused multiply-add (FMA) operations to accumulate results into a temporary buffer. This function utilizes bit manipulation and vector operations to efficiently compute the contributions of each matrix element to the final result. The use of unrolling and vectorized operations indicates an emphasis on maximizing throughput and minimizing latency, which are critical for high-performance GPU computations.

Overall, this shader is a specialized piece of code focused on high-performance linear algebra operations, specifically matrix-vector multiplication. It is designed to be part of a larger system where it would be invoked to process data in parallel, making it suitable for applications requiring significant computational power, such as scientific simulations, graphics rendering, or machine learning tasks. The inclusion of external extensions and the use of specific layout qualifiers suggest that it is tailored for a specific hardware architecture, ensuring optimal performance on compatible devices.
# Functions

---
### calc\_superblock
The `calc_superblock` function computes a matrix multiplication operation on a subset of data blocks, applying specific transformations and storing intermediate results in a temporary buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `a_offset`: The offset in the data array 'data_a' to start reading from.
    - `b_offset`: The offset in the data array 'data_b_v4' to start reading from.
    - `itid`: The thread index within a workgroup, ranging from 0 to 15.
    - `i`: The current block index being processed.
    - `num_blocks_per_row`: The number of blocks per row in the data matrix.
    - `first_row`: The index of the first row to process.
    - `num_rows`: The number of rows to process.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the y-index and nibble shift based on the input parameters.
    - Determine the initial block index 'ibi' using the offsets and block indices.
    - Iterate over the number of rows specified by 'num_rows'.
    - For each row, retrieve a data element 'd' and a scale factor from 'data_a'.
    - Compute a scaled value 'db' using the data element and scale factor.
    - Iterate twice to process two sets of quantized values 'qs' from 'data_a'.
    - For each quantized value, determine the sign and unpack grid values from 'iq2xs_grid'.
    - Iterate over the number of columns 'NUM_COLS'.
    - For each column, retrieve two vectors 'b0' and 'b4' from 'data_b_v4'.
    - Compute a sum using fused multiply-add operations with the vectors and grid values, considering the sign.
    - Store the computed value in the temporary buffer 'temp'.
    - Increment the block index 'ibi' by the number of blocks per row.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but updates the global temporary buffer 'temp' with computed results for each column and row processed.

### compute\_outputs
The `compute_outputs` function calculates and reduces matrix block results for a specified range of rows using parallel processing in a compute shader.
- **Inputs**:
    - `first_row`: The starting row index for the computation.
    - `num_rows`: The number of rows to process starting from the first_row.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize offsets for matrices A, B, and D using `get_offsets` function.
    - Calculate the number of blocks per row based on the number of columns and a constant `QUANT_K`.
    - Determine the number of blocks each workgroup will process and the thread's local ID and index within the workgroup.
    - Initialize a temporary storage array `temp` to zero for accumulating results.
    - Iterate over blocks assigned to the current workgroup and call `calc_superblock` to compute partial results for each block.
    - Reduce the accumulated results in `temp` using `reduce_result` function, storing the final results in the output matrix.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but writes the computed results to a global output matrix, reducing the results from the temporary storage `temp`.

### main
The `main` function initializes shared memory and coordinates the computation of matrix-vector products across workgroups, handling edge cases for remaining rows.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the `first_row` based on the workgroup's ID and the number of workgroups.
    - Initialize shared memory using `init_iq_shmem` with the workgroup size.
    - Check if the current `first_row` plus `NUM_ROWS` is within the bounds of `p.stride_d`.
    - If within bounds, call `compute_outputs` with `first_row` and `NUM_ROWS`.
    - If not within bounds, check if `first_row` is beyond `p.stride_d` and return if true.
    - Otherwise, call `compute_outputs` with `first_row` and the remaining rows (`p.stride_d - first_row`).
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it performs computations and updates shared memory and potentially global memory.
