# Purpose
The provided content is a CMake configuration file used to define the build process for a project named "vulkan-shaders-gen." This file specifies a minimum required version of CMake (3.19) and sets up the project to use both C and C++ languages. It includes conditional compilation definitions for various Vulkan shader support features, such as cooperative matrix and integer dot product support, which are enabled based on specific preprocessor directives. The file also configures the build target, "vulkan-shaders-gen," by specifying its source file, setting the C++ standard to C++17, and linking it with the Threads library. Additionally, it includes instructions for setting the runtime output directory for Microsoft Visual Studio (MSVC) builds, ensuring that the executable is placed in the correct location based on the build configuration.
