# Purpose
This code is a GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) shader file, specifically a fragment or vertex shader, as indicated by the `#version 460` directive, which specifies the GLSL version being used. The presence of `#extension GL_EXT_bfloat16 : require` suggests that this shader requires the use of the `GL_EXT_bfloat16` extension, which allows for operations with bfloat16 data types, enhancing precision and performance in certain graphics computations. The `void main()` function is the entry point for the shader, but it is currently empty, indicating that this file serves as a template or a starting point for further development rather than providing any specific functionality. This shader file is intended to be part of a larger graphics application, where it would be compiled and executed by the GPU to perform rendering tasks.
# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function is an entry point for a GLSL shader program that currently performs no operations.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined as the entry point for a GLSL shader program.
    - It is marked with the `#version 460` directive, indicating the GLSL version.
    - The `#extension GL_EXT_bfloat16 : require` directive is included, which requires support for the `GL_EXT_bfloat16` extension.
    - The function body is empty, meaning no operations or calculations are performed.
- **Output**: The function does not produce any output as it contains no operations or return statements.
