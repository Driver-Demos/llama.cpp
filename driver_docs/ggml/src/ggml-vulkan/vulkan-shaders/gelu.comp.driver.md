# Purpose
This code is a GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) compute shader, which is designed to perform parallel computations on the GPU. The shader is written for version 450 of GLSL and includes extensions for control flow attributes, indicating that it may utilize advanced control flow features. The shader is structured to operate on data buffers, with one buffer (`X`) being read-only and another buffer (`D`) being write-only. These buffers are bound to specific binding points, allowing the shader to access and modify data stored in them.

The primary functionality of this shader is to apply a mathematical transformation to each element in the input buffer `X` and store the result in the output buffer `D`. The transformation involves a Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) activation function, which is commonly used in neural networks to introduce non-linearity. The shader calculates an index `i` based on the global invocation ID, which determines the specific element of the buffer to process. It then checks if this index is within bounds before performing the computation. The computation involves constants such as `GELU_COEF_A` and `SQRT_2_OVER_PI`, which are used in the GELU formula to transform the input data.

Overall, this shader provides a narrow but specific functionality focused on applying the GELU activation function to a dataset in parallel, leveraging the GPU's capabilities for efficient computation. It is a specialized component likely used within a larger graphics or compute pipeline, where such transformations are necessary for tasks like machine learning inference or other data processing applications.
# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function performs a computation on elements of a read-only buffer and writes the results to a write-only buffer using a specific mathematical formula.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data_a`: A read-only buffer of type `A_TYPE` containing input data.
    - `data_d`: A write-only buffer of type `D_TYPE` where the computed results are stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the global index `i` using the global invocation IDs and constants.
    - Check if `i` is greater than or equal to `p.KX`; if so, exit the function early.
    - Convert the `i`-th element of `data_a` to a float and store it in `xi`.
    - Compute an intermediate value `val` using the constants `SQRT_2_OVER_PI`, `GELU_COEF_A`, and `xi`.
    - Calculate the final result using the formula `0.5f*xi*(2.0f - 2.0f / (exp(2 * val) + 1))` and store it in the `i`-th position of `data_d`.
- **Output**: The function writes the computed result to the `i`-th position of the `data_d` buffer.
