# Purpose
This code is a compute shader written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) version 450, designed to perform parallel computations on a GPU. The shader is structured to process data in blocks, with a defined block size of 512, and utilizes the GPU's parallel processing capabilities to efficiently compute statistical measures such as mean and variance for a dataset. The shader reads input data from a buffer bound to binding point 0 and writes the processed results to a buffer bound to binding point 1. The use of shared memory (`shared vec2 sum[BLOCK_SIZE];`) allows for efficient accumulation of partial results within each workgroup.

The shader includes two external files, "generic_head.comp" and "types.comp", which likely define common functions and data types used across multiple shader programs. The shader employs the `GL_EXT_control_flow_attributes` extension to optimize loop unrolling, enhancing performance by reducing the overhead of loop control. The main function calculates the mean and variance of input data, normalizes it, and writes the normalized data to the output buffer. The use of barriers ensures synchronization among threads within a workgroup, allowing for the correct accumulation of results.

Overall, this shader provides a focused functionality for data normalization, leveraging the parallel processing power of GPUs. It is a specialized component intended to be part of a larger graphics or compute pipeline, where it can be used to preprocess data for machine learning, image processing, or other computational tasks that benefit from parallel execution.
# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function performs parallel computation to normalize input data using mean and variance calculations in a compute shader.
- **Inputs**:
    - `gl_WorkGroupID`: A built-in variable that provides the workgroup's ID in the 3D grid of workgroups.
    - `gl_LocalInvocationID`: A built-in variable that provides the local invocation index within the workgroup.
    - `data_a`: An array of type `A_TYPE` representing the input data buffer, accessed in a read-only manner.
    - `data_d`: An array of type `D_TYPE` representing the output data buffer, accessed in a write-only manner.
    - `p.KX`: A parameter representing the number of columns to process.
    - `p.param1`: A parameter used in the variance calculation to prevent division by zero.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the `row` and `tid` variables to determine the current work item and thread ID.
    - Set the initial value of `sum[tid]` to a zero vector.
    - Iterate over columns with a stride of `BLOCK_SIZE`, accumulating sums and squared sums into `sum[tid]`.
    - Synchronize threads with a barrier to ensure all partial sums are computed before reduction.
    - Perform a reduction on `sum` to compute the total sum and squared sum across the workgroup.
    - Calculate the mean and variance from the reduced sums.
    - Compute the inverse standard deviation using the variance and `p.param1`.
    - Normalize the input data using the computed mean and inverse standard deviation, storing the result in `data_d`.
- **Output**: The function writes normalized data to the `data_d` buffer, with each element being a `D_TYPE` value.
