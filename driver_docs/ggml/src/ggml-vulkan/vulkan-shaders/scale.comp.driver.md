# Purpose
This code is a compute shader written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) version 450, designed to perform parallel computations on a GPU. The shader is structured to execute a specific task across multiple threads, leveraging the GPU's parallel processing capabilities. The primary function of this shader is to perform a unary operation on an array of data, as indicated by the inclusion of "generic_unary_head.comp," which likely defines the operation's specifics. The shader is configured to run with a local workgroup size of 128 threads along the x-axis, as specified by the `layout(local_size_x = num_threads, local_size_y = 1, local_size_z = 1)` directive.

The main function of the shader calculates an index `idx` using a function `get_idx()`, which is presumably defined in the included files. The shader then iterates over a loop, performing a computation on elements of an input array `data_a` and storing the results in an output array `data_d`. The computation involves multiplying each element by a parameter `p.param1`, which is likely a uniform or constant value passed to the shader. The loop is unrolled for optimization, as indicated by the `[[unroll]]` directive, which suggests that the loop's iterations are expanded at compile time to improve performance.

Overall, this shader file provides a narrow functionality focused on executing a specific mathematical operation on an array of data in parallel. It is part of a larger system, as suggested by the inclusion of external files "types.comp" and "generic_unary_head.comp," which likely define data types and the specific unary operation, respectively. The shader does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly but is intended to be integrated into a larger graphics or compute pipeline where it can be invoked with appropriate input data and parameters.
# Global Variables

---
### num\_threads
- **Type**: `uint`
- **Description**: The variable `num_threads` is a global constant of type unsigned integer, set to the value 128. It is used to define the number of threads in the x-dimension of the compute shader's workgroup.
- **Use**: This variable is used to specify the local workgroup size for the compute shader, influencing parallel execution.


# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function is a compute shader entry point that processes data in parallel using multiple threads, applying a unary operation to elements of an input array and storing the results in an output array.
- **Inputs**:
    - `None`: The function does not take any direct input parameters; it operates on global variables and constants defined elsewhere in the shader program.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `idx` with the result of `get_idx()` to determine the starting index for the current thread.
    - Define a constant `num_iter` as 4, ensuring that the total number of iterations across all threads matches the expected workload.
    - Enter a loop that iterates `num_iter` times, unrolling the loop for performance optimization.
    - In each iteration, check if `idx` is greater than or equal to `p.ne` (the number of elements to process); if so, skip the current iteration.
    - If the index is valid, perform a unary operation on the input data at the current index, multiply it by a parameter, and store the result in the output array.
    - Increment `idx` by `num_threads` to process the next set of elements in the subsequent iterations.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it writes the processed data to the `data_d` array, which is a global output buffer.
