# Purpose
This code is a GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) compute shader designed to perform dequantization operations on a set of data. The shader is intended to be executed on a GPU, leveraging parallel processing capabilities to efficiently handle large datasets. The primary function of this shader is to read quantized data from a read-only buffer, perform dequantization calculations, and write the results to a write-only buffer. The shader operates on data blocks, where each thread processes a subblock consisting of a scale and 32 quantized values.

The shader is structured to work with a specific local workgroup size of 256 threads along the x-axis, which is defined by the `layout(local_size_x = 256, local_size_y = 1, local_size_z = 1)` directive. This configuration allows the shader to efficiently map its operations to the GPU's architecture. The shader reads from a buffer `A`, which contains the quantized data, and writes the dequantized results to buffer `D`. The dequantization process involves calculating a scale factor from the quantized data, applying it to the quantized values, and storing the results in the output buffer. The shader uses bit manipulation to extract scale values and applies a predefined transformation using a lookup table `kvalues_iq4nl` to convert quantized values into dequantized floating-point numbers.

Overall, this shader provides a specialized functionality focused on dequantization, which is a common operation in graphics and data processing applications where data compression and decompression are required. The shader is not a standalone executable but rather a component that would be integrated into a larger graphics or compute pipeline, where it can be invoked to process data in parallel on the GPU.
# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function processes quantized data from a read-only buffer and writes dequantized values to a write-only buffer using GPU parallelism.
- **Inputs**:
    - `gl_WorkGroupID`: A built-in variable that provides the work group ID for the current invocation.
    - `gl_LocalInvocationID`: A built-in variable that provides the local invocation ID within the work group.
    - `gl_WorkGroupSize`: A built-in variable that provides the size of the work group.
    - `data_a`: A read-only buffer containing quantized data blocks.
    - `data_b`: A write-only buffer where dequantized data will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the index `ib` for the current thread based on work group and local invocation IDs.
    - Initialize shared memory for the work group using `init_iq_shmem`.
    - Check if `ib` is out of bounds (greater than or equal to `p.nel / 256`), and return early if true.
    - Calculate `ib32` as the remainder of the local invocation ID divided by 8.
    - Retrieve the scale factor `d` from the quantized data at index `ib`.
    - Compute the scale value using bit manipulation on `scales_l` and `scales_h` fields.
    - Calculate the dequantization factor `dl` by adjusting the scale value with `d`.
    - Determine the base index `b_idx` for writing to the output buffer and the quantized index `q_idx`.
    - Iterate over 16 values, dequantize each using a lookup table `kvalues_iq4nl`, and store the results in the output buffer `data_b`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it writes dequantized data to the `data_b` buffer.
