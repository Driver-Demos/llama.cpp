# Purpose
This code is a GLSL compute shader designed for performing matrix operations, specifically matrix multiplication, on the GPU. It leverages various extensions to handle different data types and arithmetic operations, such as 16-bit storage and cooperative matrix operations, which are crucial for optimizing performance on modern GPUs. The shader is structured to handle different configurations and data types, including float16, int16, and bfloat16, among others, allowing it to be versatile in handling various computational tasks.

The shader is organized to work with multiple buffers, which are defined using the `layout` qualifier. These buffers include read-only buffers for input matrices A and B, and a write-only buffer for the output matrix D. The shader uses shared memory to store intermediate results, which helps in reducing the number of global memory accesses and thus improves performance. The use of `push_constant` and `constant_id` allows for flexible configuration of the shader's behavior, such as setting block sizes and matrix dimensions, which are essential for tailoring the shader to specific workloads.

The main function of the shader orchestrates the matrix multiplication process. It includes logic for loading data into shared memory, performing the matrix multiplication using either cooperative matrix operations or traditional methods, and storing the results back into the output buffer. The shader is designed to handle different matrix sizes and configurations, including support for batched operations and broadcasting, making it suitable for a wide range of applications in graphics and compute-intensive tasks.
# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function is a GPU shader program that performs matrix multiplication and stores the result in a buffer, with support for various data types and configurations.
- **Inputs**:
    - `none`: The function does not take any direct input arguments, but it uses several pre-defined constants, macros, and buffer layouts.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by initializing shared memory and determining the workgroup and invocation IDs.
    - It calculates indices and strides for accessing input buffers A and B based on the workgroup and invocation IDs.
    - The function enters a loop over blocks of data, loading data from buffers A and B into shared memory, with different handling based on data type macros.
    - A barrier is used to synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory.
    - The function performs matrix multiplication using either cooperative matrix operations or standard operations, depending on the COOPMAT macro.
    - Results are stored back into the output buffer D, with handling for different data types and alignment conditions.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it writes the result of the matrix multiplication to the output buffer D.
