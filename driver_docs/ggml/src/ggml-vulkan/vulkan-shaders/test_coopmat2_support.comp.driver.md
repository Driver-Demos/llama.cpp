# Purpose
This code is a GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) shader file, specifically a fragment or vertex shader, as indicated by the `#version 460` directive, which specifies the GLSL version being used. The presence of `#extension GL_NV_cooperative_matrix2 : require` suggests that this shader is intended to leverage the NVIDIA-specific extension for cooperative matrix operations, which can be used for advanced graphics computations or optimizations. The `void main()` function is the entry point for the shader, but it is currently empty, indicating that this file serves as a template or starting point for further development. Overall, this file provides narrow functionality as it is designed to be part of a larger graphics pipeline, where it will be compiled and executed on the GPU to perform specific rendering tasks.
# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function is an entry point for a GLSL shader program that currently does nothing.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined as the entry point for a GLSL shader program.
    - It is marked with the `#version 460` directive, indicating the GLSL version.
    - The `#extension GL_NV_cooperative_matrix2 : require` directive is used, suggesting the use of a specific extension, though it is not utilized in the function body.
    - The function body is empty, indicating no operations are performed.
- **Output**: The function does not produce any output as it contains no operations or return statements.
