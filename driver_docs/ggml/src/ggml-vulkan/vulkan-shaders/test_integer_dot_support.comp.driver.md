# Purpose
This code is a GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) shader file, specifically a fragment or vertex shader, as indicated by the `#version 460` directive, which specifies the GLSL version being used. The presence of `#extension GL_EXT_integer_dot_product : require` suggests that this shader requires the use of the integer dot product extension, which is typically used for operations involving integer vectors. The `void main()` function is the entry point for the shader, but it is currently empty, indicating that this file serves as a template or a starting point for further development rather than providing any specific functionality. Overall, this shader file provides narrow functionality, as it is intended to be part of a larger graphics pipeline where it will be compiled and executed on the GPU to perform specific rendering tasks.
# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function is an entry point for a GLSL shader program that currently contains no operations or logic.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined with the `void` return type, indicating it does not return any value.
    - The function body is empty, meaning no operations or logic are executed when the function is called.
- **Output**: The function does not produce any output as it is empty and has a `void` return type.
