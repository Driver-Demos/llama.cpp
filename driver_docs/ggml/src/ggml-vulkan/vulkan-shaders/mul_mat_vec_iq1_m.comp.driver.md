# Purpose
This source code is a GLSL compute shader designed to perform matrix-vector multiplication using a block-based approach. The shader is written for the OpenGL Shading Language version 450 and utilizes the `GL_EXT_shader_explicit_arithmetic_types_int32` extension to handle explicit arithmetic types. The primary functionality of this shader is to compute the product of a matrix and a vector by processing data in superblocks, which are smaller, manageable chunks of the matrix. This approach is efficient for parallel processing on the GPU, leveraging the compute capabilities of modern graphics hardware.

The shader defines two main functions: `calc_superblock` and `compute_outputs`. The `calc_superblock` function is responsible for calculating the contribution of a superblock to the final result. It iterates over rows and columns of the matrix, applying scaling factors and quantization adjustments to compute intermediate results stored in a temporary buffer. The `compute_outputs` function orchestrates the overall computation by initializing temporary storage, determining offsets, and invoking `calc_superblock` for each block of data. It also handles the reduction of results to produce the final output.

The shader is structured to be executed in parallel across multiple workgroups, with each workgroup processing a portion of the matrix. The `main` function initializes shared memory and determines the range of rows to process based on the workgroup's ID. It ensures that the computation is performed efficiently by processing a fixed number of rows at a time, adjusting for any remaining rows if necessary. This shader is a specialized component of a larger graphics or compute pipeline, likely used in applications requiring high-performance linear algebra operations, such as machine learning or scientific simulations.
# Functions

---
### calc\_superblock
The `calc_superblock` function computes a matrix multiplication operation on a subset of data blocks, applying specific scaling and transformation logic to update a temporary result matrix.
- **Inputs**:
    - `a_offset`: The offset in the data array 'a' from which to start processing.
    - `b_offset`: The offset in the data array 'b' from which to start processing.
    - `ib32`: An index used to determine specific scaling and transformation operations.
    - `i`: The current block index being processed.
    - `num_blocks_per_row`: The number of blocks per row in the data matrix.
    - `first_row`: The index of the first row to process.
    - `num_rows`: The number of rows to process.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the y-index using the current block index and ib32.
    - Initialize the block index 'ibi' using the offsets and block indices.
    - Iterate over the number of rows specified by 'num_rows'.
    - For each row, extract scaling factors and compute a scaling value 'd'.
    - Iterate over a fixed number of elements (4) to apply quantization and scaling logic.
    - For each element, compute a delta value based on quantization bits and apply scaling.
    - Iterate over the number of columns to process each column of the matrix.
    - For each column, load data from the 'b' matrix and compute a sum using fused multiply-add operations.
    - Update the temporary result matrix 'temp' with the computed values.
    - Increment the block index 'ibi' for the next row.
- **Output**: The function updates the global temporary matrix 'temp' with computed values based on the input data and scaling logic.

### compute\_outputs
The `compute_outputs` function calculates and reduces matrix multiplication results for a specified range of rows using parallel processing in a GPU shader.
- **Inputs**:
    - `first_row`: The starting row index for the computation.
    - `num_rows`: The number of rows to process starting from the first_row.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize offsets for matrices A, B, and D using the `get_offsets` function.
    - Calculate the number of blocks per row based on the number of columns and a constant `QUANT_K`.
    - Determine the number of blocks each workgroup will process and the thread's local ID within the workgroup.
    - Initialize a temporary storage array `temp` to zero for accumulating results.
    - Iterate over blocks assigned to the current workgroup and call `calc_superblock` to compute partial results for each block.
    - Call `reduce_result` to finalize and store the computed results from `temp` into the output matrix.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but writes the computed results to a global output matrix, reducing the results from the temporary storage `temp`.

### main
The `main` function initializes shared memory and computes matrix-vector multiplication outputs for a specific range of rows, handling edge cases where the number of rows is less than expected.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the starting row index `first_row` based on the work group ID and number of work groups.
    - Initialize shared memory using `init_iq_shmem` with the work group size.
    - Check if the current block of rows (`first_row` to `first_row + NUM_ROWS`) is within the bounds of `p.stride_d`.
    - If within bounds, call `compute_outputs` for the full `NUM_ROWS`.
    - If not within bounds, check if `first_row` is beyond `p.stride_d` and return if true.
    - Otherwise, call `compute_outputs` for the remaining rows from `first_row` to `p.stride_d`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it performs computations and updates shared memory or global state.
