# Purpose
This code is a GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) compute shader designed to perform parallel computations on a GPU. The shader is written for version 450 of GLSL and utilizes the `GL_EXT_control_flow_attributes` extension to enhance control flow capabilities. The primary purpose of this shader is to process data stored in a read-only buffer `A` and write results to a write-only buffer `D`. The shader operates on a grid of workgroups, each with a specified local size, and is configured to handle data in blocks, as indicated by the `BLOCK_SIZE` constant.

The shader's main functionality involves finding the maximum value in a segment of the input buffer `A` and storing the result in the output buffer `D`. It uses shared memory to store intermediate results (`tmpmax` and `tmp` arrays) for efficient parallel reduction. The shader employs a parallel reduction algorithm to determine the maximum value within a block of data, leveraging barriers to synchronize threads within a workgroup. The use of the `[[unroll]]` attribute suggests an optimization to unroll loops for performance gains.

This shader is a specialized component intended for high-performance computing tasks on the GPU, particularly those involving large-scale data processing where parallel execution can significantly enhance performance. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces but rather serves as a backend computational tool within a larger graphics or compute pipeline. The inclusion of headers like "generic_head.comp" and "types.comp" suggests modularity, allowing for the reuse of common definitions and types across different shader programs.
# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function performs a parallel reduction to find the maximum value and its index in a subset of a buffer, storing the result in another buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `gl_WorkGroupID`: A built-in variable that provides the workgroup's unique ID in the 3D grid of workgroups.
    - `gl_LocalInvocationID`: A built-in variable that provides the local invocation's unique ID within the workgroup.
    - `data_a`: A read-only buffer containing elements of type A_TYPE, representing the input data.
    - `data_d`: A write-only buffer where the result of type D_TYPE will be stored.
    - `p.KX`: A constant or uniform variable representing the number of elements in a row of the input buffer.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the row index using the workgroup ID components.
    - Calculate the column index using the local invocation ID.
    - Check if the column index is within bounds; if not, exit the function.
    - Initialize the maximum value and its index for the current column.
    - Iterate over the elements in the row, updating the maximum value and its index if a larger value is found.
    - Store the maximum value in shared memory and synchronize all threads with a barrier.
    - Perform a parallel reduction to find the maximum value and its index across all columns in the workgroup.
    - If the current column is the first one, store the result in the output buffer.
- **Output**: The function writes the index of the maximum value found in the input buffer to the output buffer `data_d` for each row processed by the workgroup.
