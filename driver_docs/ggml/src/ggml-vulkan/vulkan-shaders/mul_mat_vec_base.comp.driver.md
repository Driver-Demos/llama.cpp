# Purpose
This code is a GLSL compute shader designed for parallel processing on a GPU. It is structured to handle matrix operations, likely involving matrix multiplication or similar tasks, as indicated by the use of multiple buffers and the calculation of offsets for accessing data. The shader utilizes several extensions, such as `GL_EXT_control_flow_attributes`, `GL_EXT_shader_16bit_storage`, and `GL_EXT_shader_8bit_storage`, which enhance its capabilities in terms of control flow and data storage precision. The shader is configured to read from multiple input buffers (`A`, `B`, `BV2`, `BV4`) and write results to an output buffer (`D`). The use of conditional compilation with `#ifdef MUL_MAT_ID` suggests that the shader can be configured for different operational modes, possibly to handle different types of matrix operations or data layouts.

The shader defines a set of push constants, which are used to pass parameters such as the number of columns, strides, and batch sizes to the shader at runtime. These parameters are crucial for calculating the correct memory offsets when accessing the input and output buffers. The function `get_offsets` is responsible for determining these offsets based on the current invocation ID and the provided parameters, ensuring that each thread processes the correct segment of data. The shader also includes a reduction function, `reduce_result`, which aggregates partial results computed by different threads and writes the final result back to the output buffer. This function uses shared memory to store intermediate results and employs a barrier synchronization to ensure correct data aggregation.

Overall, this shader is a specialized piece of code intended for high-performance computation on a GPU, leveraging parallel processing capabilities to efficiently handle large-scale matrix operations. It is designed to be flexible, with configurable parameters and conditional compilation options that allow it to adapt to different data layouts and processing requirements. The inclusion of external files, such as `types.comp` and `dequant_funcs.comp`, suggests that this shader is part of a larger system, possibly a library or framework for GPU-accelerated computations.
# Functions

---
### get\_offsets
The `get_offsets` function calculates the offsets for accessing elements in buffers A, B, and D based on the current invocation ID and various parameters.
- **Inputs**:
    - `a_offset`: A reference to an unsigned integer where the calculated offset for buffer A will be stored.
    - `b_offset`: A reference to an unsigned integer where the calculated offset for buffer B will be stored.
    - `d_offset`: A reference to an unsigned integer where the calculated offset for buffer D will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if MUL_MAT_ID is defined to determine the mode of operation.
    - If MUL_MAT_ID is defined, use the global invocation ID to determine the expert index.
    - If MUL_MAT_ID is not defined, calculate the batch index and subsequently the batch index for buffer A using the provided parameters.
    - Calculate the offset for buffer A using either the expert ID or the batch index for buffer A, depending on the mode.
    - Calculate the offset for buffer B using either the expert index or the batch index, depending on the mode.
    - Calculate the offset for buffer D using either the expert index or the batch index, depending on the mode.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but modifies the input references to store the calculated offsets for buffers A, B, and D.

### reduce\_result
The `reduce_result` function performs a parallel reduction on a shared memory array to sum partial results and writes the final result to a global buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `temp`: A 2D array of type FLOAT_TYPE with dimensions [NUM_COLS][NUM_ROWS] containing the partial sums to be reduced.
    - `d_offset`: A uint32_t representing the offset in the output buffer where the result should be written.
    - `first_row`: A uint32_t indicating the starting row in the output buffer for writing the result.
    - `num_rows`: A uint32_t specifying the number of rows to process in the reduction.
    - `tid`: A uint32_t representing the thread ID within the block, used for indexing shared memory.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize shared memory `tmpsh` with values from `temp` for each column and row.
    - Synchronize threads with a barrier to ensure all threads have written to shared memory.
    - Perform a reduction in shared memory by iteratively halving the number of active threads and summing values from higher indices to lower indices.
    - Synchronize threads with a barrier after each reduction step to ensure all threads have completed their operations.
    - If the thread ID is 0, write the reduced result from shared memory to the global buffer `data_d` at the specified offset and row.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but writes the reduced result to the global buffer `data_d` at the specified offset and row.
