# Purpose
This code is a GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) compute shader designed to perform parallel processing on data buffers. The shader is intended to be executed on the GPU, leveraging its parallel processing capabilities to efficiently handle large datasets. The primary function of this shader is to dequantize data from a read-only buffer `A` and write the processed results to a write-only buffer `D`. The shader operates on blocks of data, with each thread in the compute shader responsible for processing a subblock of 32 values, utilizing two scales for dequantization.

The shader is structured to work with a specific local workgroup size of 256 threads along the x-axis, which is defined by the `layout(local_size_x = 256, local_size_y = 1, local_size_z = 1)` directive. This configuration allows the shader to efficiently map its operations to the GPU's architecture. The shader uses several GLSL built-in variables such as `gl_WorkGroupID` and `gl_LocalInvocationID` to determine the specific portion of the data each thread will process. The shader also includes a mechanism to handle edge cases where the number of elements (`p.nel`) may not be perfectly divisible by the workgroup size, ensuring that it does not attempt to process out-of-bounds data.

The shader's logic involves extracting quantization parameters from the input buffer, performing bitwise operations to decode these parameters, and applying a dequantization formula to compute the final values. The use of `bitfieldExtract` and other bitwise operations indicates that the data is stored in a compact, encoded format, which the shader decodes and scales appropriately. The shader's design is highly specialized, focusing on the efficient dequantization of data, making it a critical component in applications where data compression and decompression are necessary, such as in graphics rendering or machine learning inference tasks on the GPU.
# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function processes data from a read-only buffer and writes transformed results to a write-only buffer using GPU parallelization.
- **Inputs**:
    - `gl_WorkGroupID`: A built-in variable that provides the ID of the workgroup in the dispatch grid.
    - `gl_LocalInvocationID`: A built-in variable that provides the ID of the invocation within the local workgroup.
    - `gl_WorkGroupSize`: A built-in variable that provides the size of the workgroup.
    - `data_a`: A read-only buffer containing input data of type `block_iq1_s`.
    - `data_b`: A write-only buffer where the output data of type `D_TYPE` will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the index `ib` for the current thread based on workgroup and local invocation IDs.
    - Initialize shared memory using `init_iq_shmem` with the workgroup size.
    - Check if `ib` is out of bounds (greater than or equal to `p.nel / 256`), and return early if true.
    - Calculate `ib32` and `b_idx` to determine the specific subblock and base index for writing results.
    - Extract quantization header `qh` and scale `d` from the input buffer `data_a`.
    - Compute `dl` and `delta` for scaling and offsetting the data.
    - Iterate over 4 subblocks, extracting quantization values and high bits to compute a grid index.
    - For each subblock, iterate over 8 elements, compute the transformed value using `dl` and `delta`, and store it in the output buffer `data_b`.
- **Output**: The function writes transformed data to the `data_b` buffer, with each thread handling a specific subblock of data.
