# Purpose
This code is a shader file, likely intended for use in a graphics application, and it provides narrow functionality specific to GPU operations. It includes two OpenGL extensions, `GL_EXT_control_flow_attributes` and `GL_EXT_shader_16bit_storage`, which suggest that it is designed to enhance control flow and storage capabilities within the shader. The file defines a `push_constant` uniform block named `parameter`, which contains several unsigned integer variables (`M`, `K`, `stride_a`, `stride_b`, and `nel`) that are likely used to control aspects of the shader's execution, such as matrix dimensions or memory strides. Additionally, it includes an external file, "types.comp", which suggests that this shader relies on predefined types or functions declared elsewhere, indicating modularity and reusability within a larger graphics pipeline.
