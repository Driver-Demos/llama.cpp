# Purpose
This code is a GLSL compute shader designed to perform a dequantization operation on data stored in GPU buffers. The shader is written for OpenGL version 4.5 and is intended to be executed on the GPU to leverage parallel processing capabilities. The shader reads from a read-only buffer `A` and writes the processed results to a write-only buffer `D`. The buffers are bound to specific binding points, allowing the shader to access the data efficiently during execution.

The shader operates on data in parallel using a workgroup layout defined by `layout(local_size_x = 64, local_size_y = 1, local_size_z = 1)`, which specifies that each workgroup consists of 64 threads. The main function iterates over a range of indices, performing calculations to dequantize the data. It uses bit manipulation and arithmetic operations to extract and transform the quantized data from buffer `A`, applying scaling factors and shifts to produce the dequantized output, which is then stored in buffer `D`. The use of `[[unroll]]` suggests an optimization hint to the compiler to unroll the loop for performance gains.

The shader is a specialized component focused on the dequantization process, which is a common operation in graphics and machine learning applications where data is often stored in a compressed format to save space and bandwidth. By offloading this task to the GPU, the shader can handle large datasets efficiently, making it suitable for real-time applications that require high throughput and low latency.
# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function processes data from a read-only buffer, performs dequantization and transformation operations, and writes the results to a write-only buffer using a compute shader.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data_a`: A read-only buffer of type `A_TYPE` containing input data with fields like `scales`, `d`, `qs`, and `hmask`.
    - `data_b`: A write-only buffer of type `D_TYPE` where the processed output data will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function iterates over a loop with `wgy` ranging from 0 to 255, calculating an index `i` based on the work group ID and `wgy`.
    - It checks if `i` is greater than or equal to `p.M * p.K / QUANT_K`, and if so, it exits the function early.
    - Within the loop, several indices and values are calculated based on the local invocation ID and other derived values.
    - A nested loop iterates over a range of `l` values, performing dequantization and transformation on the data from `data_a` and storing the results in `data_b`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it writes processed data to the `data_b` buffer.
