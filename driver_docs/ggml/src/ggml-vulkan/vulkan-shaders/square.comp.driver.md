# Purpose
This code is a compute shader written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) version 4.5, designed to run on the GPU. It provides narrow functionality, specifically for performing element-wise squaring of data in a parallelized manner. The shader is structured to handle a large number of elements efficiently by leveraging the GPU's parallel processing capabilities, as indicated by the `layout(local_size_x = 512, local_size_y = 1, local_size_z = 1)` directive, which defines the workgroup size. The code includes external dependencies through `#include` directives for "types.comp" and "generic_unary_head.comp", suggesting that it relies on predefined types and possibly utility functions or macros. The main function calculates an index, checks bounds, and performs the squaring operation, storing the result in a destination buffer, which is typical for GPU-based data processing tasks.
# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function performs a parallel computation to square elements from an input array and store the results in an output array, using GPU shader programming.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the current index using the `get_idx()` function.
    - Check if the current index is greater than or equal to `p.ne`; if so, exit the function.
    - Calculate the value at the current index from the input array `data_a`, convert it to `FLOAT_TYPE`, and store it in `val`.
    - Square the value `val` and store the result in the output array `data_d` at the corresponding index.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it writes the squared values to the `data_d` array.
