# Purpose
This source code is a GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) compute shader designed to perform matrix-vector multiplication using a parallel processing approach. The shader is written for the OpenGL 4.5 version and utilizes the `GL_EXT_shader_explicit_arithmetic_types_int32` extension to handle explicit 32-bit integer arithmetic types. The code is structured to handle large-scale computations by dividing the workload across multiple threads, leveraging the GPU's parallel processing capabilities to efficiently compute the results.

The shader's primary function is to calculate the product of a matrix and a vector, which is a common operation in graphics and scientific computing. The `calc_superblock` function is central to this process, as it handles the computation of a "superblock" of the matrix, using shared memory (`sccache`) to store intermediate results and optimize memory access patterns. The function processes data in blocks, using bitwise operations to unpack and manipulate packed data formats, which is typical in high-performance computing to reduce memory bandwidth usage.

The `main` function orchestrates the execution of the shader, determining the range of rows to process based on the workgroup and grid dimensions. It calls `compute_outputs`, which initializes temporary storage and iteratively calls `calc_superblock` to perform the matrix-vector multiplication. The shader is designed to handle varying numbers of rows and blocks, adapting to the available resources and ensuring that all computations are completed efficiently. This code is a specialized component of a larger graphics or computation pipeline, focusing on high-performance matrix operations.
# Global Variables

---
### sccache
- **Type**: `FLOAT_TYPE[2][BLOCK_SIZE/16][16]`
- **Description**: The `sccache` variable is a shared memory array used within the compute shader to store intermediate floating-point values during matrix computations. It is a three-dimensional array with dimensions determined by the constants `BLOCK_SIZE` and `FLOAT_TYPE`, which are likely defined elsewhere in the code. The array is indexed by three indices, where the first index toggles between two states, the second index is based on the block size, and the third index is fixed at 16.
- **Use**: This variable is used to cache scale values for matrix computations, allowing for efficient data reuse and synchronization across threads within a workgroup.


---
### temp
- **Type**: `FLOAT_TYPE[][]`
- **Description**: The variable `temp` is a two-dimensional array of type `FLOAT_TYPE` with dimensions `NUM_COLS` by `NUM_ROWS`. It is used to store intermediate results of matrix computations during the execution of the shader program.
- **Use**: This variable is used to accumulate and store the results of matrix-vector multiplications and other arithmetic operations performed within the `calc_superblock` and `compute_outputs` functions.


---
### csel
- **Type**: `uint`
- **Description**: The `csel` variable is a global unsigned integer used to toggle between two states, typically 0 and 1, within the shader program. It is used to select between two sets of cached data in the shared memory `sccache`. This toggling mechanism is crucial for managing data access and synchronization across different threads in the compute shader.
- **Use**: `csel` is used to alternate between two indices in the `sccache` array, facilitating efficient data caching and retrieval during matrix computations.


# Functions

---
### calc\_superblock
The `calc_superblock` function performs matrix-vector multiplication and quantization operations on blocks of data within a compute shader.
- **Inputs**:
    - `a_offset`: The offset for accessing data in the 'a' matrix.
    - `b_offset`: The offset for accessing data in the 'b' matrix.
    - `itid`: The thread-local index within a workgroup, ranging from 0 to 15.
    - `ix`: The index of the current thread divided by 16, used for block processing.
    - `ql_offset`: The offset for accessing low quantization data.
    - `qh_offset`: The offset for accessing high quantization data.
    - `s_offset`: The offset for accessing scale data.
    - `y_offset`: The offset for accessing 'y' data.
    - `i`: The current block index being processed.
    - `num_blocks_per_row`: The number of blocks per row in the matrix.
    - `first_row`: The index of the first row to process.
    - `num_rows`: The number of rows to process.
    - `all_threads`: A boolean indicating whether all threads are used for processing.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the index `y_idx` based on the current block index and offsets.
    - Iterate over each row specified by `num_rows`.
    - For each row, calculate the block index `ib0` and toggle the `csel` variable.
    - If not all threads are used, check if the current thread index `i` is less than `num_blocks_per_row` to load scale data into shared memory and synchronize threads.
    - If the current thread index `i` is greater than or equal to `num_blocks_per_row`, continue to the next iteration.
    - Extract and combine quantization data from packed arrays into 32-bit integers for low and high parts.
    - Unpack these integers into vectors `q0`, `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` and adjust their values.
    - If all threads are used, load scale data into shared memory and synchronize threads.
    - Retrieve the scale factor `d` for the current block.
    - Iterate over each column specified by `NUM_COLS`.
    - For each column, load vectors from the 'b' matrix and perform fused multiply-add operations with the quantized vectors to accumulate results.
    - Store the computed results in the `temp` array, applying scaling and adding the scale factor `d`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `temp` array in place with the computed results of the matrix-vector multiplication and quantization operations.

### compute\_outputs
The `compute_outputs` function calculates and stores the results of matrix-vector multiplications for a specified range of rows using parallel processing in a GPU shader.
- **Inputs**:
    - `first_row`: The starting row index for the computation.
    - `num_rows`: The number of rows to process starting from the first_row.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize offsets for matrices A, B, and D using `get_offsets` function.
    - Calculate the number of blocks per row based on the number of columns and a constant `QUANT_K`.
    - Determine the size of each thread group and calculate thread-specific indices for processing.
    - Initialize a temporary storage array `temp` to zero for accumulating results.
    - Calculate the number of blocks that can be processed by all threads and those that require partial threads.
    - Iterate over the blocks that can be processed by all threads, calling `calc_superblock` with `all_threads` set to true.
    - Process any remaining blocks with `calc_superblock` with `all_threads` set to false.
    - Call `reduce_result` to finalize and store the computed results.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies global state by storing computed results in a shared or global memory location.

### main
The `main` function orchestrates the computation of matrix-vector multiplication in a parallelized manner using GPU shaders, processing a set number of rows at a time.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the starting row index `first_row` based on the work group ID and number of work groups.
    - Check if there are enough rows remaining to process `NUM_ROWS` at a time; if so, call `compute_outputs` with `NUM_ROWS`.
    - If not enough rows remain, check if `first_row` is beyond the data limit; if so, exit the function.
    - If `first_row` is within the data limit but not enough rows remain, call `compute_outputs` with the remaining rows.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it performs computations and writes results to a shared memory or buffer.
