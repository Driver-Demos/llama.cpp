# Purpose
The provided content is a CMake configuration script used to define build settings for a software project. It specifies that the build type should be "Release" and sets optimization flags for both C and C++ compilers to "-O2" to enhance performance. The script also configures the CMake find path modes for programs, libraries, and includes to "NEVER," indicating that it should not search for these in the root path. The C and C++ compilers are set using placeholders, which are likely replaced with actual compiler paths during the build process. Additionally, for projects using the Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) compiler, it ensures that the runtime output directory is consistently set across different build configurations such as DEBUG, RELEASE, MINSIZEREL, and RELWITHDEBINFO.
