# Purpose
This source code file is designed to implement a 2D pooling operation on a GPU using CUDA, specifically for data in the NCHW format (batch size, channels, height, width). The file defines a CUDA kernel function, `pool2d_nchw_kernel`, which performs the core computation of the pooling operation. This kernel supports both average pooling and max pooling, as indicated by the `ggml_op_pool` enumeration. The kernel processes input data by iterating over specified regions of the input tensor, applying the pooling operation, and writing the results to the output tensor. The kernel is templated to support different input and output data types, enhancing its flexibility.

The file also includes a function, `pool2d_nchw_kernel_f32_f32_cuda`, which serves as a wrapper to launch the CUDA kernel with specific parameters. This function calculates the number of blocks needed for the kernel execution based on the number of parallel elements and the block size, and it launches the kernel on a given CUDA stream. This setup allows for efficient execution of the pooling operation on the GPU, leveraging CUDA's parallel processing capabilities.

Finally, the function `ggml_cuda_op_pool2d` acts as an interface for the pooling operation within a larger framework, likely part of a neural network library. It extracts necessary parameters from the input and output tensors, such as dimensions and operation type, and prepares them for the kernel launch. This function ensures that the input and output data types are compatible with the expected float32 format, and it manages the CUDA stream context for the operation. Overall, this file provides a specialized and efficient implementation of 2D pooling for use in GPU-accelerated machine learning applications.

# Functions

---
### pool2d\_nchw\_kernel
The `pool2d_nchw_kernel` function performs 2D pooling operations (average or max) on input data in NCHW format using CUDA for parallel computation.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ih`: The height of the input tensor.
    - `iw`: The width of the input tensor.
    - `oh`: The height of the output tensor.
    - `ow`: The width of the output tensor.
    - `kh`: The height of the pooling kernel.
    - `kw`: The width of the pooling kernel.
    - `sh`: The stride along the height.
    - `sw`: The stride along the width.
    - `ph`: The padding along the height.
    - `pw`: The padding along the width.
    - `parallel_elements`: The total number of elements to be processed in parallel.
    - `src`: Pointer to the input data array.
    - `dst`: Pointer to the output data array.
    - `op`: The pooling operation to perform, either average or max.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the global index `idx` for the current thread based on block and thread indices.
    - Check if `idx` is within the bounds of `parallel_elements`; if not, return early.
    - Calculate the input and output channel indices and the current output height and width indices.
    - Determine the start and end indices for the pooling window in both height and width dimensions, considering padding.
    - Initialize the result `res` based on the pooling operation (0 for average, negative infinity for max).
    - Iterate over the pooling window, loading input values and updating `res` based on the pooling operation.
    - Store the computed result `res` in the output array at the appropriate location.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it writes the pooled results directly to the `dst` output array.

    - Launch the `pool2d_nchw_kernel` CUDA kernel with the specified parameters, which performs the pooling operation on the input data and writes the result to the output data.

### ggml\_cuda\_op\_pool2d
The `ggml_cuda_op_pool2d` function performs a 2D pooling operation on a tensor using CUDA, supporting average and max pooling.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A reference to a `ggml_backend_cuda_context` object, which provides the CUDA stream for execution.
    - `dst`: A pointer to a `ggml_tensor` object that serves as the destination tensor for the pooling operation, containing metadata and storage for the result.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the source tensor `src0` from the `dst` tensor's source array.
    - Extract the data pointers `src0_d` and `dst_d` for the source and destination tensors, respectively.
    - Obtain the CUDA stream from the context `ctx`.
    - Assert that both the source and destination tensors are of type `GGML_TYPE_F32`.
    - Extract pooling operation parameters from `dst->op_params`, including the operation type, kernel size, stride, and padding.
    - Calculate the input height `IH`, input width `IW`, and the number of parallel elements based on the dimensions of the source and destination tensors.
    - Invoke the `pool2d_nchw_kernel_f32_f32_cuda` function to perform the pooling operation on the GPU using the specified parameters.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `dst` tensor in place to store the result of the pooling operation.
