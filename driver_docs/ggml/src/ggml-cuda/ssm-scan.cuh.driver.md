# Purpose
This code appears to be a header file or a part of a CUDA-based library, as indicated by the inclusion of "common.cuh" and the use of CUDA-specific types and operations. The function `ggml_cuda_op_ssm_scan` is declared, suggesting that this file is intended to provide a specific operation or functionality related to CUDA processing, likely involving tensor operations given the parameter `ggml_tensor * dst`. The purpose of this file is relatively narrow, focusing on defining or declaring a specific operation that can be used in CUDA-based applications, possibly for machine learning or data processing tasks. The use of a context parameter (`ggml_backend_cuda_context & ctx`) indicates that this function might be part of a larger framework or library that manages CUDA resources and operations.
# Imports and Dependencies

# Functions

### ggml\_cuda\_op\_ssm\_scan
The function `ggml_cuda_op_ssm_scan` performs a scan operation on a tensor using CUDA within a given backend context.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A reference to a `ggml_backend_cuda_context` object, which provides the CUDA backend context for the operation.
    - `dst`: A pointer to a `ggml_tensor` object, which is the destination tensor where the scan operation results will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes in a CUDA backend context and a destination tensor as inputs.
    - It performs a scan operation on the destination tensor using the provided CUDA context.
    - The specifics of the scan operation are not detailed in the provided code snippet, but it likely involves parallel processing using CUDA capabilities.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the destination tensor `dst` in place.
