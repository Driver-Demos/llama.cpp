# Purpose
This code appears to be a header file that declares a set of functions related to normalization operations in a CUDA-based backend, likely for a machine learning or data processing library. The functions, such as `ggml_cuda_op_norm`, `ggml_cuda_op_group_norm`, and `ggml_cuda_op_rms_norm`, suggest that the file provides narrow functionality focused on different types of normalization techniques, which are essential in neural network training and data preprocessing. The inclusion of "common.cuh" indicates that it relies on common CUDA utilities or definitions shared across multiple files. This file is intended to be included in other source files where these normalization operations are implemented or utilized, facilitating modularity and reusability in the codebase.
