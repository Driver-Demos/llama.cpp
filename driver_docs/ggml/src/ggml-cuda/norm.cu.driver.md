# Purpose
This source code file is a CUDA-based implementation for various normalization operations on floating-point data arrays. It defines several GPU kernels and their corresponding host functions to perform different types of normalization, including standard normalization, group normalization, RMS normalization, and L2 normalization. The file is structured to leverage CUDA's parallel processing capabilities, using templates to define kernels that can be instantiated with different block sizes, optimizing for different data sizes and GPU architectures.

The key technical components of this file include the use of CUDA's grid and block dimensions to manage parallel execution across multiple threads and blocks. The kernels utilize warp-level primitives like `warp_reduce_sum` to efficiently compute partial sums across threads within a warp, and shared memory is used to aggregate results across warps when necessary. The file also includes host functions that configure and launch these kernels, determining the appropriate block size based on the number of columns in the data to be processed.

This code is intended to be part of a larger library or application that requires efficient normalization operations on large datasets, particularly in a machine learning or data processing context. It provides a set of public APIs for each normalization type, which are designed to be called from other parts of the application, passing in data pointers, dimensions, and other parameters necessary for the normalization process. The use of CUDA streams allows for asynchronous execution, which can be integrated into a larger pipeline of GPU-accelerated operations.

### ggml\_cuda\_op\_norm
The `ggml_cuda_op_norm` function performs normalization on a tensor using CUDA, ensuring the output tensor is normalized according to specified parameters.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A `ggml_backend_cuda_context` object that provides the CUDA stream for execution.
    - `dst`: A `ggml_tensor` object representing the destination tensor where the normalized data will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the source tensor `src0` from the destination tensor `dst`.
    - Extract the data pointers for the source and destination tensors.
    - Obtain the CUDA stream from the context `ctx`.
    - Assert that both source and destination tensors are of type `GGML_TYPE_F32`.
    - Retrieve the epsilon value from the operation parameters of the destination tensor.
    - Calculate the strides for rows, channels, and samples based on the source tensor's type size.
    - Invoke the `norm_f32_cuda` function with the appropriate parameters to perform the normalization on the GPU.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `dst` tensor in place to contain the normalized data.
