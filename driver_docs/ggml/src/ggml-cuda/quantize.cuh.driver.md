# Purpose
This code is a header file, as indicated by the `#pragma once` directive, which is used to prevent multiple inclusions of the file. It provides a narrow functionality focused on CUDA-based quantization operations, specifically for matrix data. The file includes two other header files, "common.cuh" and "mmq.cuh", suggesting it relies on common utilities and matrix-matrix quantization operations defined elsewhere. It defines constants for block sizes used in CUDA operations and includes static assertions to ensure safe memory access. The file declares a function pointer type `quantize_cuda_t` and two functions, `quantize_row_q8_1_cuda` and `quantize_mmq_q8_1_cuda`, which are likely implemented elsewhere and are intended to perform quantization on data using CUDA streams, indicating its role in high-performance computing tasks.
