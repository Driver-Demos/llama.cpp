# Purpose
This code appears to be a header file, as it includes a function declaration without providing the implementation, suggesting that the actual logic is defined elsewhere. The function `ggml_cuda_op_ssm_conv` is likely part of a larger library or framework that interfaces with CUDA, indicating that it is designed for GPU-accelerated operations. The inclusion of `"common.cuh"` suggests that this file relies on common CUDA utilities or definitions shared across multiple components. The functionality provided by this file is relatively narrow, focusing on a specific operation (`ssm_conv`) within a CUDA context, which is likely part of a broader set of GPU-accelerated mathematical or machine learning operations.
# Functions

---
### ggml\_cuda\_op\_ssm\_conv
The function `ggml_cuda_op_ssm_conv` performs a convolution operation on a tensor using CUDA within a given CUDA context.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A reference to a `ggml_backend_cuda_context` object that provides the CUDA execution context for the operation.
    - `dst`: A pointer to a `ggml_tensor` object that represents the destination tensor where the result of the convolution operation will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by accessing the CUDA context provided by the `ctx` parameter.
    - It then performs a convolution operation on the tensor data, utilizing CUDA for parallel computation.
    - The result of the convolution is stored in the tensor pointed to by `dst`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `dst` tensor in place with the result of the convolution operation.
