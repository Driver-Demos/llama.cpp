# Purpose
This source code file is designed to perform row-wise summation of a matrix using CUDA, a parallel computing platform and application programming interface model created by NVIDIA. The file contains a CUDA kernel function, `k_sum_rows_f32`, which is responsible for computing the sum of each row in a matrix of 32-bit floating-point numbers. The kernel is executed on the GPU, leveraging parallel processing capabilities to efficiently compute the sum of elements in each row. The kernel uses a warp-level reduction technique to sum the elements, ensuring that the computation is optimized for the GPU architecture.

The file also defines a function, `sum_rows_f32_cuda`, which sets up the execution configuration for the kernel, specifying the number of blocks and threads per block. This function is responsible for launching the kernel on the GPU, passing the necessary parameters such as the input matrix, the destination array for the results, the number of columns, and the CUDA stream for asynchronous execution. The use of CUDA streams allows for concurrent execution of multiple operations, improving the overall performance of the application.

Additionally, the file includes a function, `ggml_cuda_op_sum_rows`, which integrates the CUDA row summation operation into a larger framework, likely part of a machine learning or numerical computation library. This function retrieves the source tensor, validates its type and contiguity, and then calls `sum_rows_f32_cuda` to perform the computation. The function is designed to work with a specific backend context, `ggml_backend_cuda_context`, indicating that it is part of a modular system where different backends can be used for computation. This modularity allows for flexibility in choosing the appropriate computational resources, such as CPU or GPU, based on the available hardware and performance requirements.

# Functions

---
### k\_sum\_rows\_f32
The `k_sum_rows_f32` function computes the sum of each row in a 2D float array using CUDA parallelization and stores the results in a destination array.
- **Inputs**:
    - `x`: A pointer to the input 2D float array from which row sums are computed.
    - `dst`: A pointer to the output array where the computed row sums will be stored.
    - `ncols`: An integer representing the number of columns in each row of the input array.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is executed on the GPU with each block handling a separate row of the input array.
    - Each thread within a block iterates over a subset of columns, accumulating the sum of elements in the `sum` variable.
    - The `warp_reduce_sum` function is called to perform a reduction operation across threads in a warp to compute the total sum for the row.
    - The first thread in each block (i.e., `col == 0`) writes the computed sum to the corresponding position in the `dst` array.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but writes the sum of each row to the `dst` array.

### sum\_rows\_f32\_cuda
The `sum_rows_f32_cuda` function computes the sum of each row in a 2D float array using CUDA for parallel processing.
- **Inputs**:
    - `x`: A pointer to the input 2D float array stored in a contiguous memory layout.
    - `dst`: A pointer to the output array where the sum of each row will be stored.
    - `ncols`: The number of columns in the input array.
    - `nrows`: The number of rows in the input array.
    - `stream`: A CUDA stream for managing asynchronous execution.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Define CUDA block dimensions with a warp size for efficient parallel execution.
    - Define the number of blocks to launch, corresponding to the number of rows in the input array.
    - Launch the CUDA kernel `k_sum_rows_f32` with the specified grid and block dimensions, passing the input array, output array, and number of columns.
    - Within the kernel, each thread computes a partial sum of the row elements it is responsible for, iterating over columns with a stride equal to the block dimension.
    - Use warp-level reduction to sum the partial results from threads within a warp.
    - The first thread in each block writes the final sum of the row to the output array.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but writes the sum of each row to the `dst` array.


---
### ggml\_cuda\_op\_sum\_rows
The function `ggml_cuda_op_sum_rows` computes the sum of each row in a 2D tensor using CUDA and stores the results in a destination tensor.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A reference to a `ggml_backend_cuda_context` object, which provides the CUDA stream for execution.
    - `dst`: A pointer to a `ggml_tensor` object where the result of the row sums will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the source tensor `src0` from the `dst` tensor's source array.
    - Extract the data pointers `src0_d` and `dst_d` from the source and destination tensors, respectively.
    - Obtain the CUDA stream from the context `ctx`.
    - Assert that both the source and destination tensors are of type `GGML_TYPE_F32`.
    - Assert that the source tensor is contiguous in memory.
    - Calculate the number of columns `ncols` and rows `nrows` from the source tensor's dimensions.
    - Call the `sum_rows_f32_cuda` function to perform the row summation on the GPU.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `dst` tensor in place to contain the sum of each row from the source tensor.
