# Purpose
This source code file is a CUDA-based implementation for concatenating two tensors along a specified dimension. The file defines several CUDA kernels and a function to handle the concatenation operation, both for contiguous and non-contiguous memory layouts. The primary purpose of this code is to efficiently concatenate two floating-point tensors (`src0` and `src1`) into a destination tensor (`dst`) using GPU acceleration, which is particularly useful for large-scale data processing tasks where performance is critical.

The file includes multiple static CUDA kernel functions, such as `concat_f32_dim0`, `concat_f32_dim1`, and `concat_f32_dim2`, each designed to handle concatenation along different dimensions (0, 1, and 2, respectively). These kernels calculate the appropriate offsets for reading from the source tensors and writing to the destination tensor, ensuring that the data is correctly aligned in memory. The `concat_f32_cuda` function orchestrates the execution of these kernels based on the specified dimension, utilizing CUDA's grid and block structures to parallelize the operation across the GPU.

Additionally, the file contains a template-based kernel `concat_f32_non_cont` for handling non-contiguous memory layouts, which is inherently slower due to the additional complexity in calculating memory offsets. The `ggml_cuda_op_concat` function serves as the main entry point for the concatenation operation, determining whether the source tensors are contiguous and selecting the appropriate kernel to execute. This function also manages the CUDA stream for asynchronous execution, ensuring that the operation can be integrated smoothly into larger GPU-accelerated workflows.

# Functions

### concat\_f32\_dim0
The `concat_f32_dim0` function concatenates two float arrays along the first dimension (dim0) using CUDA for parallel processing.
- **Inputs**:
    - `x`: A pointer to the first input float array.
    - `y`: A pointer to the second input float array.
    - `dst`: A pointer to the destination float array where the result will be stored.
    - `ne0`: The total number of elements along the first dimension of the destination array.
    - `ne00`: The number of elements along the first dimension of the first input array.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the global thread index `nidx` using `threadIdx.x`, `blockIdx.x`, and `blockDim.x`.
    - Check if `nidx` is greater than or equal to `ne0`; if so, return immediately to avoid out-of-bounds access.
    - Calculate the destination offset `offset_dst` using `nidx`, `blockIdx.y`, `blockIdx.z`, and `gridDim.y`.
    - If `nidx` is less than `ne00`, calculate the source offset for the first array `offset_src` and copy the element from `x` to `dst`.
    - Otherwise, calculate the source offset for the second array `offset_src` and copy the element from `y` to `dst`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it writes the concatenated result directly into the `dst` array.

### concat\_f32\_dim1
The `concat_f32_dim1` function concatenates two float arrays along the first dimension using CUDA parallel processing.
- **Inputs**:
    - `x`: Pointer to the first input float array.
    - `y`: Pointer to the second input float array.
    - `dst`: Pointer to the destination float array where the result will be stored.
    - `ne0`: The size of the first dimension of the arrays.
    - `ne01`: The size of the first dimension of the first input array, used to determine the boundary for concatenation.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the global thread index `nidx` using `threadIdx.x` and `blockIdx.x`.
    - Check if `nidx` is greater than or equal to `ne0`; if so, return immediately to avoid out-of-bounds access.
    - Compute the destination offset `offset_dst` using `nidx`, `blockIdx.y`, and `blockIdx.z`.
    - Determine if the current block's y-index `blockIdx.y` is less than `ne01` to decide whether to copy from `x` or `y`.
    - If copying from `x`, calculate the source offset `offset_src` using `nidx`, `blockIdx.y`, and `blockIdx.z`, and copy the value from `x` to `dst`.
    - If copying from `y`, adjust the source offset `offset_src` by subtracting `ne01` from `blockIdx.y`, and copy the value from `y` to `dst`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `dst` array in place by concatenating `x` and `y` along the first dimension.

### concat\_f32\_dim2
The `concat_f32_dim2` function concatenates two float arrays along the third dimension (z-axis) using CUDA parallel processing.
- **Inputs**:
    - `x`: Pointer to the first source float array.
    - `y`: Pointer to the second source float array.
    - `dst`: Pointer to the destination float array where the result will be stored.
    - `ne0`: The size of the first dimension of the arrays.
    - `ne02`: The size of the third dimension of the first source array, used to determine the boundary for concatenation.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the global thread index `nidx` using `threadIdx.x` and `blockIdx.x`.
    - Check if `nidx` is greater than or equal to `ne0`; if so, return immediately to avoid out-of-bounds access.
    - Calculate the destination offset `offset_dst` using `nidx`, `blockIdx.y`, and `blockIdx.z`.
    - Check if `blockIdx.z` is less than `ne02` to determine if the current element should be copied from the first source array `x`.
    - If true, calculate the source offset `offset_src` for `x` and copy the element from `x` to `dst`.
    - If false, calculate the source offset `offset_src` for `y` and copy the element from `y` to `dst`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `dst` array in place to contain the concatenated result of `x` and `y` along the third dimension.

    - If dim is 2, launch the `concat_f32_dim2` kernel with the appropriate grid and block dimensions.

    - If the tensors are not contiguous, set up a grid dimension and launch the `concat_f32_non_cont` kernel with the appropriate dimension template parameter.
    - Use a switch statement to select the correct dimension for the non-contiguous kernel launch.
    - Handle invalid dimension cases with an abort operation.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `dst` tensor in place to contain the concatenated result of `src0` and `src1`.
