# Purpose
This code appears to be a header file for a CUDA-based library, providing a narrow functionality focused on a specific operation, likely related to tensor manipulation or data processing. The file includes a common header file, "common.cuh," suggesting it relies on shared definitions or utilities, and it defines a constant, `CUDA_CONCAT_BLOCK_SIZE`, which is likely used to configure the block size for CUDA operations. The function declaration `ggml_cuda_op_concat` indicates that this file is part of a larger system designed to perform concatenation operations on tensors using CUDA, and it is intended to be used in conjunction with other components of a CUDA-based backend for a machine learning or data processing framework.
