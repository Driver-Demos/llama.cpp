# Purpose
This code appears to be a header file for a CUDA-based implementation of cross-entropy loss functions, which are commonly used in machine learning for classification tasks. The file defines a constant, `CUDA_CROSS_ENTROPY_LOSS_BLOCK_SIZE`, which likely specifies the block size for CUDA kernel execution, optimizing parallel computation on the GPU. It declares two functions, `ggml_cuda_cross_entropy_loss` and `ggml_cuda_cross_entropy_loss_back`, which suggest forward and backward pass computations for cross-entropy loss, respectively, within a CUDA context. This file provides narrow functionality focused on GPU-accelerated computation of cross-entropy loss, intended to be included and used in other parts of a larger machine learning framework or application.
