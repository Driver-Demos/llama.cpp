# Purpose
This code appears to be a header file, as it contains function declarations without implementations, which are typically used to define interfaces for other parts of a program to use. The file provides narrow functionality related to CUDA operations, specifically for copying and duplicating tensor data within a CUDA context, as indicated by the function names and the inclusion of a CUDA-specific header file ("common.cuh"). The functions declared here suggest that this file is part of a larger library or framework designed to handle tensor operations on NVIDIA GPUs, likely for machine learning or scientific computing applications. The presence of CUDA-specific types and operations indicates that this code is intended to be used in environments where GPU acceleration is leveraged for performance improvements.
