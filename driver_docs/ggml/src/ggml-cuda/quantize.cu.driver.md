# Purpose
This source code file is a CUDA-based implementation for quantizing floating-point data into a more compact 8-bit integer representation. The file contains two primary CUDA kernel functions, `quantize_q8_1` and `quantize_mmq_q8_1`, which are designed to perform quantization on input data arrays. These functions are executed on the GPU to leverage parallel processing capabilities, which is essential for handling large datasets efficiently. The quantization process involves scaling the input floating-point values to fit within the range of 8-bit integers, which helps in reducing memory usage and potentially speeding up subsequent computations.

The `quantize_q8_1` function is a CUDA kernel that processes input data in a straightforward manner, computing the maximum absolute value and sum of the input data, and then using these to scale and quantize the data into 8-bit integers. The function uses CUDA-specific constructs such as `blockDim`, `blockIdx`, and `threadIdx` to manage parallel execution across multiple threads. The `quantize_mmq_q8_1` function, on the other hand, is a templated CUDA kernel that supports different data layout configurations, allowing for more flexible quantization strategies. It processes data in blocks, calculates the maximum absolute value, and performs quantization similarly to `quantize_q8_1`, but with additional considerations for different data layouts.

The file also includes two wrapper functions, `quantize_row_q8_1_cuda` and `quantize_mmq_q8_1_cuda`, which set up the execution configuration for the CUDA kernels and launch them on a specified CUDA stream. These functions handle the configuration of grid and block dimensions based on the input data size and layout, ensuring that the kernels are executed efficiently. The file is intended to be part of a larger system where quantization is a necessary step, possibly for machine learning or data compression tasks, where reducing the precision of data can lead to significant performance improvements without substantial loss of information.
