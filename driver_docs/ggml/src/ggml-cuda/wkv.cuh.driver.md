# Purpose
This code appears to be a header file, as it includes function declarations without implementations and a preprocessor directive. It provides narrow functionality specific to CUDA operations, likely related to the RWKV (Recurrent Weighted Key-Value) model, as suggested by the function names. The inclusion of "common.cuh" indicates that it relies on shared CUDA utilities or definitions, and the defined constant `CUDA_WKV_BLOCK_SIZE` suggests a configuration parameter for CUDA kernel execution. The file is intended to be used in conjunction with other source files that implement the declared functions, facilitating CUDA-based operations on tensors within a specific backend context.
