# Purpose
This code appears to be a header file that defines a set of type aliases and function prototypes for CUDA-based data type conversion operations. It provides relatively narrow functionality focused on converting data between different floating-point formats (such as float, half, and nv_bfloat16) using CUDA, which is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface model created by NVIDIA. The file defines function pointer types for both contiguous and non-contiguous data conversion operations, indicating that it is designed to handle various data layouts in memory. The presence of function prototypes like `ggml_get_to_fp16_cuda` suggests that these functions are intended to be implemented elsewhere, likely in a corresponding source file, and used to retrieve specific conversion functions based on the data type. The inclusion of a TODO comment hints at future enhancements to support more complex data structures.
