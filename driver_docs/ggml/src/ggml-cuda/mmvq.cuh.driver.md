# Purpose
This code appears to be a header file for a CUDA-based library, providing specialized functions for matrix-vector operations on GPU. The file defines two functions, `ggml_cuda_mul_mat_vec_q` and `ggml_cuda_op_mul_mat_vec_q`, which are likely intended to perform matrix-vector multiplication using CUDA, a parallel computing platform and application programming interface model created by NVIDIA. The presence of the `MMVQ_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` macro suggests that the code is optimized for specific batch sizes, indicating a focus on performance for certain workloads. The inclusion of "common.cuh" implies that this file relies on shared utilities or definitions, which are likely used across multiple components of the library. Overall, this file provides narrow functionality focused on GPU-accelerated mathematical operations, and it is intended to be part of a larger system where it is imported and utilized by other components.
