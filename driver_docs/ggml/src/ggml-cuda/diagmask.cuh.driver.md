# Purpose
This code appears to be a header file for a CUDA-based application, providing a narrow and specific functionality related to GPU operations. It includes a common header file, "common.cuh," suggesting that it relies on shared definitions or utilities for CUDA operations. The file defines a constant, `CUDA_DIAG_MASK_INF_BLOCK_SIZE`, which likely specifies a block size for CUDA kernel execution, indicating its role in configuring GPU computations. Additionally, it declares a function, `ggml_cuda_op_diag_mask_inf`, which is intended to be implemented elsewhere and is likely responsible for performing a specific operation on a tensor using CUDA, possibly involving diagonal masking with infinity values. This file is designed to be included in other source files that require this specific CUDA operation.
# Functions

---
### ggml\_cuda\_op\_diag\_mask\_inf
The function `ggml_cuda_op_diag_mask_inf` applies a diagonal mask with infinite values to a tensor using CUDA.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A reference to a `ggml_backend_cuda_context` object, which provides the CUDA context for the operation.
    - `dst`: A pointer to a `ggml_tensor` object, which is the destination tensor to which the diagonal mask with infinite values will be applied.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined to operate within a CUDA context, as indicated by the inclusion of 'common.cuh' and the use of CUDA-specific constructs.
    - The function does not have an explicit body in the provided code, suggesting it may be defined elsewhere or is a placeholder for future implementation.
    - The function is intended to modify the `dst` tensor by applying a diagonal mask with infinite values, as suggested by its name and the defined block size constant `CUDA_DIAG_MASK_INF_BLOCK_SIZE`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `dst` tensor in place.
