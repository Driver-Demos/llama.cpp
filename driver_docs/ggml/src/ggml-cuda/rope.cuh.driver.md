# Purpose
This code appears to be a header file for a CUDA-based library, providing declarations for GPU-accelerated operations related to a "rope" functionality, likely used in tensor computations. The file includes a common header file, "common.cuh," suggesting it relies on shared definitions or utilities. It defines a constant, `CUDA_ROPE_BLOCK_SIZE`, which likely specifies the block size for CUDA kernel execution, optimizing performance for the operations. The two function declarations, `ggml_cuda_op_rope` and `ggml_cuda_op_rope_back`, indicate that this file is part of a broader library intended to be imported and used elsewhere, providing specific operations on tensors within a CUDA context. This file offers narrow functionality focused on enhancing tensor operations with GPU acceleration.
