# Purpose
This code appears to be a header file for a CUDA-based library, providing specific functionality related to softmax operations on tensors. It defines a constant, `CUDA_SOFT_MAX_BLOCK_SIZE`, which likely sets a limit on the block size for CUDA operations, indicating a focus on performance optimization for GPU computations. The file declares two functions, `ggml_cuda_op_soft_max` and `ggml_cuda_op_soft_max_back`, which suggest that the library supports both forward and backward softmax operations, possibly for use in neural network computations or other machine learning tasks. The inclusion of `"common.cuh"` implies that this file relies on shared utilities or definitions provided elsewhere, indicating a modular design. Overall, this file provides narrow functionality focused on enhancing CUDA-based tensor operations within a larger software framework.
