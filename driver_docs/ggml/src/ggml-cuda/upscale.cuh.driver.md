# Purpose
This code appears to be a header file for a CUDA-based library, providing a specific function declaration for GPU operations. The file includes a common header file, "common.cuh," suggesting it relies on shared definitions or utilities, and it defines a constant, `CUDA_UPSCALE_BLOCK_SIZE`, which likely configures the block size for CUDA kernel execution. The primary functionality offered by this file is narrow, focusing on the declaration of a single function, `ggml_cuda_op_upscale`, which is intended to perform an upscale operation on a tensor using CUDA, as indicated by the function name and parameters. This file is likely part of a larger library or framework designed for GPU-accelerated tensor operations, and it is intended to be included in other source files where the upscale operation is implemented or invoked.
# Functions

---
### ggml\_cuda\_op\_upscale
The function `ggml_cuda_op_upscale` performs an upscaling operation on a tensor using CUDA.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A reference to a `ggml_backend_cuda_context` object, which provides the CUDA context for the operation.
    - `dst`: A pointer to a `ggml_tensor` object, which is the destination tensor where the upscaled result will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined to take two parameters: a CUDA context and a destination tensor.
    - The function likely uses CUDA parallel processing to perform the upscaling operation on the tensor, although the specific implementation details are not provided in the code snippet.
    - The function utilizes a predefined block size (`CUDA_UPSCALE_BLOCK_SIZE`) for CUDA operations, suggesting that the upscaling is performed in parallel blocks of this size.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `dst` tensor in place to store the upscaled result.
