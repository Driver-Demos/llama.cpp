# Purpose
This code appears to be a header file or a part of a header file, as it includes a function declaration without an accompanying implementation. The function `ggml_cuda_flash_attn_ext` is likely intended to be used in a CUDA-based application, given the inclusion of "common.cuh," which suggests a CUDA header file. The function seems to be designed for extending or interfacing with a CUDA backend, specifically for operations related to "flash attention," a term often associated with efficient attention mechanisms in machine learning models. The file provides narrow functionality, focusing on a specific operation within a larger CUDA-based framework, and is likely intended to be included and used in other parts of a software project that deals with GPU-accelerated computations.

### ggml\_cuda\_flash\_attn\_ext
The function `ggml_cuda_flash_attn_ext` is a CUDA-based function that performs flash attention operations on a given tensor and stores the result in a destination tensor.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A reference to a `ggml_backend_cuda_context` object that provides the CUDA context and resources needed for the operation.
    - `dst`: A pointer to a `ggml_tensor` object where the result of the flash attention operation will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined to take two parameters: a CUDA context and a destination tensor.
    - The function likely uses the CUDA context to perform operations on the GPU, although the specific operations are not detailed in the provided code.
    - The result of the operations is stored in the destination tensor `dst`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `dst` tensor in place with the results of the flash attention operation.
