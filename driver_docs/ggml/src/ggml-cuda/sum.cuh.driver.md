# Purpose
This code appears to be a header file for CUDA operations, specifically designed to provide narrow functionality related to summing operations on floating-point data. It declares two functions: `sum_f32_cuda`, which likely performs a summation of 32-bit floating-point numbers using CUDA, and `ggml_cuda_op_sum`, which seems to be a higher-level operation that might integrate with a broader CUDA-based backend context. The inclusion of "common.cuh" suggests that this file relies on shared utilities or definitions, indicating that it is part of a larger codebase focused on GPU-accelerated computations. The file is intended to be included in other source files, providing specific CUDA-based summation capabilities within a larger application or library.
