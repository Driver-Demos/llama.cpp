# Purpose
This code file appears to be a CUDA-related header file, providing declarations for functions that facilitate operations on tensors using CUDA, a parallel computing platform and application programming interface model created by NVIDIA. The file defines constants for block sizes used in CUDA operations, indicating a focus on optimizing performance for specific computational tasks. The functions `get_rows_cuda`, `ggml_cuda_op_get_rows`, and `ggml_cuda_op_get_rows_back` suggest that the file is designed to handle row extraction and related operations on tensors within a CUDA context, likely as part of a larger library or framework for GPU-accelerated machine learning or data processing tasks. The inclusion of "common.cuh" implies that this file relies on shared utilities or definitions, further indicating its role as a component within a broader system rather than a standalone executable.
