# Purpose
This code appears to be a header file, as it includes a function declaration without an accompanying implementation, suggesting that the actual logic is defined elsewhere. The function `ggml_cuda_op_gated_linear_attn` is likely part of a library or module that provides specialized operations for CUDA-enabled devices, specifically focusing on a gated linear attention mechanism. The inclusion of `"common.cuh"` indicates that it relies on common CUDA utilities or definitions shared across multiple files. The functionality is relatively narrow, targeting a specific operation within the broader context of machine learning or neural network computations on GPUs.
