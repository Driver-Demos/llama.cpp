# Purpose
This source code file contains a deprecated implementation of the WMMA (Warp Matrix Multiply-Accumulate) FlashAttention algorithm, specifically tailored for NVIDIA's Volta architecture. The code is designed to handle the differences in memory layout between Volta and subsequent architectures like Turing. The primary functionality of this file is to provide a CUDA kernel for performing efficient matrix operations using half-precision floating-point arithmetic, which is crucial for deep learning tasks that require high throughput and low precision, such as attention mechanisms in neural networks.

The file includes several key components: it defines a CUDA kernel `flash_attn_ext_f16` that performs matrix multiplications and accumulations using NVIDIA's WMMA API. This kernel is optimized for specific matrix dimensions and configurations, leveraging CUDA's capabilities to handle parallel computations efficiently. The kernel uses shared memory to store intermediate results and employs techniques like softmax computation and scaling to ensure numerical stability. The code also includes conditional compilation directives to handle different hardware platforms, such as AMD's ROCm, ensuring compatibility across various GPU architectures.

Additionally, the file defines several utility functions and templates to configure the kernel's behavior based on the input matrix dimensions and the available hardware resources. These include functions to determine the optimal number of rows to process in parallel and to configure the kernel's launch parameters. The file is structured to be integrated into a larger codebase, likely as part of a library for GPU-accelerated machine learning tasks, and it provides a specialized implementation for scenarios where the newer, more general implementations are not applicable due to architectural constraints.

    - `V`: A pointer to the value matrix in char format.
    - `mask`: A pointer to the mask matrix in char format.
    - `dst`: A pointer to the destination matrix in float format where the result will be stored.
    - `dst_meta`: A pointer to the destination metadata in float2 format.
    - `scale`: A float value used to scale the query matrix.
    - `max_bias`: A float value representing the maximum bias for the attention mechanism.
    - `m0`: A float value used in calculating the alibi slope.
    - `m1`: A float value used in calculating the alibi slope.
    - `n_head_log2`: A uint32_t value representing the logarithm base 2 of the number of heads.
    - `logit_softcap`: A float value used to cap the logits.
    - `ne00, ne01, ne02, ne03, ne10, ne11, ne12, ne13, ne31, nb31, nb01, nb02, nb03, nb11, nb12, nb13, nb21, nb22, nb23, ne0, ne1, ne2, ne3`: Various integer values representing dimensions and strides of the input and output matrices.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the FLASH_ATTN_AVAILABLE and architecture conditions are met; if not, skip the kernel execution.
    - Initialize constants and shared memory for matrix operations and padding to reduce memory bank conflicts.
    - Convert the query matrix Q to half precision, apply scaling, and store it temporarily in shared memory.
    - Load the query matrix into tensor core fragments for frequent use.
    - Iterate over previous tokens to calculate the KQ matrix tile using WMMA operations.
    - Perform softmax on the KQ matrix columns, adjusting for maximum values and applying masks if necessary.
    - Load the KQ matrix into tensor core fragments and calculate the VKQ matrix using WMMA operations.
    - Store the VKQ matrix results back into shared memory, applying scaling and accumulation.
    - Write the final results to the destination matrix, normalizing by the KQ row sum if necessary.
    - Store metadata about the maximum KQ values and row sums in the destination metadata array.
- **Output**: The function outputs the computed attention values into the `dst` matrix and stores metadata about the computation in the `dst_meta` array.

### get\_max\_power\_of\_2
The `get_max_power_of_2` function calculates the largest power of 2 that divides a given integer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `x`: An integer input for which the largest power of 2 divisor is to be calculated.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function checks if the input integer x is even.
    - If x is even, it recursively calls itself with x divided by 2 and multiplies the result by 2.
    - If x is odd, it returns 1, as no further division by 2 is possible.
- **Output**: The function returns the largest power of 2 that divides the input integer x.


---
### get\_VKQ\_stride
The `get_VKQ_stride` function calculates the number of VKQ rows that can be processed in parallel based on the head size, number of warps, and fragment size.
- **Inputs**:
    - `D`: The head size, representing the dimension of the matrix.
    - `nwarps`: The number of warps available for parallel processing.
    - `frag_m`: The fragment size, which is a parameter used to determine the granularity of processing.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the maximum power of 2 that divides D/frag_m using the helper function `get_max_power_of_2`.
    - Compare the result of `get_max_power_of_2(D/frag_m)` with `nwarps`.
    - If `get_max_power_of_2(D/frag_m)` is less than `nwarps`, multiply it by `frag_m` to get the stride.
    - Otherwise, use `nwarps` multiplied by `frag_m` as the stride.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer representing the number of VKQ rows that can be processed in parallel.

- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by determining the number of warps and fragment size based on the input parameters.
    - It retrieves the `logit_softcap` value from the operation parameters of the `KQV` tensor.
    - Depending on the value of `logit_softcap`, it selects the appropriate kernel variant (`use_logit_softcap` true or false).
    - The function then calls `launch_fattn` to execute the selected kernel with the specified parameters, including the number of warps and warp size.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it performs operations directly on the `dst` tensor, modifying it to contain the results of the FlashAttention computation.
