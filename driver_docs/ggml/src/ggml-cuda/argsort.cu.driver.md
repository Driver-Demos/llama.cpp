# Purpose
This source code file is designed to perform an argsort operation on a matrix of floating-point numbers using CUDA for parallel processing on NVIDIA GPUs. The primary functionality provided by this code is the sorting of indices of a matrix's columns based on the values in those columns, either in ascending or descending order. The code leverages CUDA's parallel computing capabilities to efficiently perform a bitonic sort, which is a parallel sorting algorithm well-suited for execution on GPU architectures.

The file contains several key components. The `ggml_cuda_swap` function is a utility for swapping two elements, which is crucial for the sorting process. The `k_argsort_f32_i32` kernel function is the core of the sorting operation, implementing the bitonic sort algorithm. It uses shared memory to store intermediate results and synchronizes threads to ensure correct sorting. The `argsort_f32_i32_cuda` function sets up the necessary parameters for the kernel execution, such as grid and block dimensions, and handles the padding of columns to the next power of two, which is required by the bitonic sort. The `ggml_cuda_op_argsort` function serves as the public interface, integrating with a larger system by accepting a context and tensor objects, and invoking the sorting operation.

Overall, this code is a specialized library file intended to be integrated into a larger system that requires efficient sorting of matrix indices on a GPU. It defines a public API through the `ggml_cuda_op_argsort` function, which is designed to be called with specific data structures and parameters, ensuring that the sorting operation is executed correctly and efficiently on compatible hardware.

# Functions

---
### ggml\_cuda\_swap
The `ggml_cuda_swap` function swaps the values of two variables of any type in a CUDA device context.
- **Inputs**:
    - `a`: A reference to the first variable to be swapped.
    - `b`: A reference to the second variable to be swapped.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Declare a temporary variable `tmp` and assign it the value of `a`.
    - Assign the value of `b` to `a`.
    - Assign the value of `tmp` to `b`.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it swaps the values of the input variables in place.

### k\_argsort\_f32\_i32
The `k_argsort_f32_i32` function performs a bitonic sort on a row of floating-point numbers and stores the sorted indices in an integer array.
- **Inputs**:
    - `x`: A pointer to the input array of floating-point numbers to be sorted.
    - `dst`: A pointer to the output array where sorted indices will be stored.
    - `ncols`: The number of columns in the input array, representing the number of elements in each row to be sorted.
    - `ncols_pad`: The padded number of columns, which is the next power of two greater than or equal to ncols, used for bitonic sorting.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function starts by determining the column and row indices using thread and block indices.
    - If the current column index exceeds the padded number of columns, the function returns early.
    - The function initializes an array of indices corresponding to the current row in shared memory.
    - A series of nested loops perform the bitonic sort, comparing and swapping indices based on the order specified (ascending or descending).
    - After sorting, the function copies the sorted indices from shared memory to the output array, excluding any padding.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but modifies the `dst` array to contain the sorted indices of the input array `x`.

### next\_power\_of\_2
The function `next_power_of_2` calculates the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to a given integer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `x`: An integer for which the next power of 2 is to be calculated.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize an integer `n` to 1.
    - Enter a while loop that continues as long as `n` is less than `x`.
    - Inside the loop, multiply `n` by 2.
    - Exit the loop when `n` is greater than or equal to `x`.
- **Output**: Returns the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to the input integer `x`.

### argsort\_f32\_i32\_cuda
The `argsort_f32_i32_cuda` function performs a bitonic sort on a 2D array of floats, sorting each row and storing the sorted indices in an integer array using CUDA.
- **Inputs**:
    - `x`: A pointer to the input 2D array of floats to be sorted.
    - `dst`: A pointer to the output array where sorted indices will be stored.
    - `ncols`: The number of columns in the input array.
    - `nrows`: The number of rows in the input array.
    - `order`: The sorting order, either ascending or descending, specified by the `ggml_sort_order` enum.
    - `stream`: The CUDA stream to be used for the kernel execution.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the next power of 2 greater than or equal to `ncols` to determine `ncols_pad`.
    - Define CUDA grid and block dimensions based on `ncols_pad` and `nrows`.
    - Allocate shared memory for the kernel based on `ncols_pad`.
    - Check if the shared memory size is within the device's limit and assert if not.
    - Launch the `k_argsort_f32_i32` kernel with the specified sorting order, grid, block dimensions, and shared memory.
    - The kernel performs a bitonic sort on each row of the input array, using shared memory to store indices.
    - The sorted indices are copied to the `dst` array, excluding any padding.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but modifies the `dst` array to contain the sorted indices of each row of the input array `x`.

### ggml\_cuda\_op\_argsort
The `ggml_cuda_op_argsort` function performs an in-place argsort operation on a tensor using CUDA, sorting the indices of the tensor's elements based on their values.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A reference to a `ggml_backend_cuda_context` object, which provides the CUDA stream for execution.
    - `dst`: A pointer to a `ggml_tensor` object where the sorted indices will be stored; it also contains the source tensor and sorting order information.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the source tensor `src0` from the `dst` tensor's source array.
    - Extract the data pointers `src0_d` for the source tensor and `dst_d` for the destination tensor.
    - Obtain the CUDA stream from the context `ctx`.
    - Assert that the source tensor is of type `GGML_TYPE_F32` and the destination tensor is of type `GGML_TYPE_I32`.
    - Assert that the source tensor is contiguous in memory.
    - Determine the number of columns `ncols` and rows `nrows` from the source tensor's dimensions.
    - Retrieve the sorting order from the `dst` tensor's operation parameters.
    - Call the `argsort_f32_i32_cuda` function to perform the argsort operation on the GPU.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `dst` tensor in-place to contain the sorted indices of the source tensor's elements.
