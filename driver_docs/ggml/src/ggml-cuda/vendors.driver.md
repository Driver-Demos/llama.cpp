## Files
- **[cuda.h](vendors/cuda.h.driver.md)**: The `cuda.h` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase includes CUDA and cuBLAS headers and defines compatibility macros for older CUDA versions.
- **[hip.h](vendors/hip.h.driver.md)**: The `hip.h` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase provides a set of macros and inline functions to facilitate the use of HIP (Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability) by mapping CUDA functions and types to their HIP equivalents, specifically targeting AMD platforms.
- **[musa.h](vendors/musa.h.driver.md)**: The `musa.h` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase provides mappings and type definitions to integrate MUSA (a GPU computing platform) with CUDA-like functionality, enabling the use of MUSA's runtime, memory, and graph operations in a manner similar to CUDA.
