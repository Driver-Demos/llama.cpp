# Purpose
This code appears to be a header file, as it includes function declarations without implementations, which are typically found in source files. The file is focused on providing narrow functionality related to CUDA operations, specifically for matrix-vector multiplication using the ggml library in a CUDA context. It defines a constant, `MMV_MAX_ROWS`, which likely serves as a threshold for deciding when to use a custom matrix-vector multiplication function over the cuBLAS library, particularly when FP16 tensor cores are available. The two declared functions, `ggml_cuda_mul_mat_vec` and `ggml_cuda_op_mul_mat_vec`, suggest that this file is part of a larger library or framework designed to perform optimized mathematical operations on tensors using GPU acceleration. This file is intended to be included in other source files where these CUDA-based operations are implemented and utilized.
