# Purpose
This code appears to be a header file for a CUDA-based library, providing a narrow functionality focused on a specific operation related to CUDA. It includes a common header file, "common.cuh," which suggests it relies on shared definitions or utilities. The file defines a constant, `CUDA_ARANGE_BLOCK_SIZE`, which likely specifies the block size for CUDA kernel execution, indicating its role in parallel computing tasks. The function declaration `ggml_cuda_op_arange` suggests that this file is part of a larger library or framework, designed to perform an "arange" operation on a tensor using CUDA, and is intended to be used in conjunction with other components of the library.
# Functions

---
### ggml\_cuda\_op\_arange
The function `ggml_cuda_op_arange` initializes a CUDA operation to fill a tensor with a sequence of numbers using the CUDA backend.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A reference to a `ggml_backend_cuda_context` object, which provides the context for CUDA operations.
    - `dst`: A pointer to a `ggml_tensor` object, which is the destination tensor to be filled with a sequence of numbers.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined to take two parameters: a CUDA context and a destination tensor.
    - The function is intended to perform operations using CUDA, as indicated by the inclusion of a CUDA header and the use of CUDA-specific definitions.
    - The function is expected to fill the destination tensor with a sequence of numbers, though the specific implementation details are not provided in the code snippet.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the destination tensor in place.
