# Purpose
This code appears to be a header file for a CUDA-based library, providing declarations for functions related to operations on matrices or tensors. The file offers narrow functionality, specifically focusing on summing rows of floating-point matrices using CUDA, which is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface model created by NVIDIA. The function `sum_rows_f32_cuda` is declared to perform the summation of rows in a matrix of 32-bit floating-point numbers, utilizing CUDA streams for potentially asynchronous execution. Additionally, the function `ggml_cuda_op_sum_rows` is declared, which likely integrates with a broader CUDA-based backend context for tensor operations, suggesting its use in a larger framework or application that handles tensor computations.
