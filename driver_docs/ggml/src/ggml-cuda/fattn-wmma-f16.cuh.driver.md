# Purpose
This code appears to be a header file, as it includes a function declaration without providing the implementation, which is typically found in a corresponding source file. The function `ggml_cuda_flash_attn_ext_wmma_f16` suggests a specialized purpose, likely related to CUDA-based operations for machine learning or neural network tasks, given the context of "flash attention" and "wmma" (Warp Matrix Multiply-Accumulate, a CUDA feature). The inclusion of "common.cuh" indicates that this file relies on shared CUDA utilities or definitions, suggesting it is part of a larger CUDA-based library or framework. Overall, the functionality provided is narrow, focusing on a specific operation within a CUDA context, likely intended for high-performance computing tasks involving tensor operations.
# Functions

---
### ggml\_cuda\_flash\_attn\_ext\_wmma\_f16
The function `ggml_cuda_flash_attn_ext_wmma_f16` is a CUDA-based implementation for performing flash attention using WMMA (Warp Matrix Multiply-Accumulate) with half-precision floating-point (f16) on a given tensor.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A reference to a `ggml_backend_cuda_context` object that provides the CUDA context and resources needed for execution.
    - `dst`: A pointer to a `ggml_tensor` object that represents the destination tensor where the result of the flash attention operation will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined to operate within a CUDA environment, as indicated by the inclusion of 'common.cuh', which suggests it uses CUDA-specific utilities or definitions.
    - The function takes a CUDA context and a tensor as inputs, implying it performs operations on the GPU.
    - The function is likely to involve matrix operations using WMMA, which is a CUDA feature for efficient matrix multiplication, specifically optimized for half-precision (f16) data types.
    - The function does not return a value, indicating that it performs its operations directly on the provided `dst` tensor.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it modifies the `dst` tensor in place with the results of the flash attention operation.
