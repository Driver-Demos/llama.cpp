# Purpose
This code appears to be a header file, as it includes a function declaration without an accompanying implementation, suggesting that the function is defined elsewhere. The function `ggml_cuda_flash_attn_ext_tile_f16` is likely part of a library intended for use with CUDA, given the inclusion of "cuda" in the function name and the inclusion of a CUDA header file (`common.cuh`). The function seems to be designed for specialized functionality related to flash attention mechanisms, possibly in the context of machine learning or neural networks, as indicated by the use of "attn" (short for attention) and "f16" (likely referring to 16-bit floating-point precision). This file provides narrow functionality, focusing on a specific operation within a larger CUDA-based application or library.
# Functions

---
### ggml\_cuda\_flash\_attn\_ext\_tile\_f16
The function `ggml_cuda_flash_attn_ext_tile_f16` is a CUDA-based operation that performs flash attention on a tensor using half-precision floating point (f16) arithmetic.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A reference to a `ggml_backend_cuda_context` object, which provides the CUDA context and resources needed for the operation.
    - `dst`: A pointer to a `ggml_tensor` object, which is the destination tensor where the result of the flash attention operation will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined to take two parameters: a CUDA context and a destination tensor.
    - The function is declared but not implemented in the provided code, indicating that its logic is defined elsewhere, likely in a separate source file or library.
    - The function is expected to perform operations related to flash attention using CUDA, leveraging the provided context and storing results in the destination tensor.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the destination tensor in place.
