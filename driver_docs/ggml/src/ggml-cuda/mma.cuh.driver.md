# Purpose
This source code file provides a set of CUDA device functions and templates that facilitate the use of NVIDIA's tensor core PTX instructions for matrix operations, specifically matrix multiplication and accumulation (MMA). The code is designed to work with CUDA's parallel thread execution model and is intended to be used in CUDA kernels to leverage the high-performance capabilities of NVIDIA's tensor cores. The file defines a series of matrix tile structures and functions that handle the loading, transposing, and multiplication of these tiles using the MMA instructions. The code is structured to support different data types, including integers and half-precision floating-point numbers (half2), and it includes conditional compilation to support different CUDA architectures and versions.

The primary technical components of this file include the `tile` struct templates, which define the layout and operations for matrix tiles of various dimensions and data types. These tiles are used to represent matrices in a format suitable for tensor core operations. The file also includes several `__device__` functions, such as `ggml_cuda_movmatrix`, which perform specific operations like matrix transposition and element-wise manipulation. The `mma` functions are particularly important as they implement the matrix multiplication and accumulation operations using inline PTX assembly, allowing for efficient execution on NVIDIA GPUs.

Overall, this file provides a specialized library for performing high-performance matrix operations on NVIDIA GPUs using tensor cores. It abstracts the complexity of PTX instructions and provides a more accessible interface for CUDA developers to perform matrix multiplications with optimized memory layouts and execution paths. The code is modular and can be integrated into larger CUDA projects that require efficient matrix computations, particularly in applications like deep learning and scientific computing where such operations are common.

### tile
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `I`: The number of rows in the matrix tile.
    - `J`: The number of columns in the matrix tile.
    - `ne`: The number of physical 32-bit elements per warp in the matrix tile.
    - `x`: An array storing the elements of the matrix tile.
- **Description**: The `tile` struct is a template-based data structure used to represent matrix tiles in CUDA programming, specifically for tensor core operations. It is parameterized by the number of rows (I), columns (J), and the data type (T) of the matrix elements. The struct provides methods to calculate the physical indices of elements within a tile, facilitating efficient memory access patterns for matrix operations. The `tile` struct is designed to work with different data types, including `int` and `half2`, and supports operations such as loading data from memory and performing matrix multiplications using CUDA's matrix multiply-accumulate (MMA) instructions.

    - `x`: An integer representing a matrix element to be transposed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the CUDA runtime version is 11.8 or higher.
    - If the version is 11.8 or higher, use the `movmatrix.sync.aligned.m8n8.trans.b16` PTX instruction to transpose the matrix element.

### get\_i
The `get_i` function calculates the row index of a thread within a matrix tile based on the tile's dimensions and the thread's linear index.
- **Inputs**:
    - `l`: An integer representing the linear index of the element within the tile.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses `if constexpr` to determine the tile dimensions (I and J) and execute the corresponding logic.
    - For a tile with dimensions I=8 and J=4 or J=8, it returns `threadIdx.x / 4`.
    - For a tile with dimensions I=16 and J=8, it returns `(l / 2) * 8 + threadIdx.x / 4`.
    - For a tile with dimensions I=16 and J=16, it returns `((l / 2) % 2) * 8 + threadIdx.x / 4`.
    - If none of the conditions match, a static assertion is triggered indicating that the template specialization is not implemented.

    - The function uses `if constexpr` to determine the tile dimensions (I, J) and execute the corresponding logic.
    - For a tile with dimensions I=8, J=4, it returns the remainder of the thread index divided by 4.
    - For a tile with dimensions I=8, J=8, it calculates the column index as 4 times the linear index plus the remainder of the thread index divided by 4.
    - For a tile with dimensions I=16, J=8, it calculates the column index as 2 times the remainder of the thread index divided by 4 plus the remainder of the linear index divided by 2.

- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a return tile of type `tile<I, J/2, half2>` with half the number of elements as `tile_float`.
    - Iterate over the elements of `tile_float` in steps of 2.
    - For each pair of elements, create a `half2` type by combining the two float elements into a single half-precision floating-point pair.
    - Store the `half2` result in the corresponding position in the return tile.
- **Output**: A tile of type `tile<I, J/2, half2>` containing half-precision floating-point numbers, with each element being a `half2` type representing two adjacent elements from the input tile.

- **Control Flow**:
    - Declare a `tile<8, 8, half2>` object `ret` to store the transposed result.
    - Use `ggml_cuda_movmatrix` to transpose the first half2 element of the input tile `t` and store it in the first element of `ret`.
    - Use `ggml_cuda_movmatrix` to transpose the second half2 element of the input tile `t` and store it in the second element of `ret`.
    - Return the transposed tile `ret`.
- **Output**: A `tile<8, 8, half2>` object representing the transposed 8x8 matrix tile.


---
### load\_generic
The `load_generic` function loads data into a matrix tile from a source array using a specified stride.
- **Inputs**:
    - `t`: A reference to a tile object of type `tile<I, J, T>` where the data will be loaded.
    - `xs0`: A pointer to the source array of type `T` from which data will be loaded.
    - `stride`: An integer representing the stride to be used when accessing elements in the source array.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function iterates over each element `l` in the tile's data array `t.x` using a loop that runs `t.ne` times, where `t.ne` is the number of elements in the tile.
    - For each element `l`, it calculates the source index using the tile's `get_i(l)` and `get_j(l)` methods, which determine the row and column indices respectively.
    - The element from the source array `xs0` at the calculated index is assigned to the corresponding position in the tile's data array `t.x`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the tile `t` in place by loading data into it from the source array `xs0`.

### load\_ldmatrix
The `load_ldmatrix` function loads a matrix tile from shared memory into a tile structure using CUDA's matrix load instructions, with support for different tile sizes and data types.
- **Inputs**:
    - `t`: A reference to a tile structure where the matrix data will be loaded.
    - `xs0`: A pointer to the source matrix data in shared memory.
    - `stride`: The stride of the matrix, indicating the number of elements between consecutive rows.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function checks if the `NEW_MMA_AVAILABLE` macro is defined to determine if the new matrix load instructions can be used.
    - If `NEW_MMA_AVAILABLE` is defined, the function uses inline assembly to load the matrix data into the tile using the `ldmatrix.sync.aligned` instruction, which is optimized for specific tile sizes and data types.
    - The specific inline assembly instruction used depends on the tile size and data type, with different instructions for 8x8, 16x4, and 16x8 tiles.
    - If `NEW_MMA_AVAILABLE` is not defined, the function falls back to a generic load function `load_generic` that manually loads the matrix data into the tile using the provided stride.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the tile `t` in place by loading matrix data into it.

    - `xs0`: A pointer to the shared memory location from which the matrix data will be loaded.
    - `stride`: An integer representing the stride (or step size) used to access elements in the shared memory.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the `NEW_MMA_AVAILABLE` macro is defined to determine if the new matrix multiply-accumulate (MMA) instructions are available.
    - If `NEW_MMA_AVAILABLE` is defined, cast the tile's data array `t.x` to an integer pointer `xi` and the input data pointer `xs0` to an integer pointer `xs`.
    - Calculate the offset for `xs` using the thread index and the tile dimensions `t.I` and `t.J`.
    - Use the `asm volatile` statement to execute the `ldmatrix.sync.aligned.m8n8.x4.trans.b16` PTX instruction, which loads the transposed matrix data into the tile `t` from the shared memory location `xs`.
    - If `NEW_MMA_AVAILABLE` is not defined, mark the input parameters `t`, `xs0`, and `stride` as unused and call `NO_DEVICE_CODE` to indicate that no device code is executed.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the input tile `t` in place by loading the transposed matrix data into it.

- **Inputs**:
    - `D`: A reference to a tile object where the result of the matrix multiplication will be stored.
    - `A`: A constant reference to a tile object representing the first matrix operand.
