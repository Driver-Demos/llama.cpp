# Purpose
This code appears to be a header file for a CUDA-based library, providing a set of function declarations for operations on tensors, such as repeat, add, subtract, multiply, and divide. The functions are designed to be used within a CUDA context, as indicated by the `ggml_backend_cuda_context` parameter, suggesting that these operations are intended to leverage GPU acceleration for performance improvements. The file offers narrow functionality focused on mathematical operations for tensor manipulation, likely as part of a larger machine learning or numerical computation framework. The inclusion of "common.cuh" suggests that it relies on shared definitions or utilities provided elsewhere in the project.
