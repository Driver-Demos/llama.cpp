# Purpose
This code appears to be a header file, as it includes a function declaration and a macro definition but lacks a main function or any executable code. The file provides narrow functionality related to CUDA operations, specifically defining a block size for CUDA padding operations and declaring a function `ggml_cuda_op_pad` that likely performs padding on a tensor using CUDA. The inclusion of `"common.cuh"` suggests that it relies on shared CUDA utilities or definitions, indicating that this file is part of a larger CUDA-based library or application. The purpose of this file is to facilitate CUDA-based tensor operations, likely within a machine learning or numerical computation context.
# Functions

---
### ggml\_cuda\_op\_pad
The function `ggml_cuda_op_pad` performs a padding operation on a tensor using CUDA.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A reference to a `ggml_backend_cuda_context` object, which provides the CUDA context for the operation.
    - `dst`: A pointer to a `ggml_tensor` object, which is the destination tensor that will be padded.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined to take two parameters: a CUDA context and a destination tensor.
    - The function likely uses CUDA to perform operations on the GPU, as indicated by the inclusion of 'common.cuh' and the use of CUDA-specific terminology.
    - The function is expected to perform padding on the `dst` tensor, although the specific padding logic is not detailed in the provided code snippet.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `dst` tensor in place.
