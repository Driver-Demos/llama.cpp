# Purpose
This code appears to be a header file or a part of a header file that provides a declaration for a function intended to be used in a CUDA-based application. The function `ggml_cuda_op_argsort` is likely designed to perform an argsort operation on a tensor, which is a common operation in machine learning and data processing tasks. The inclusion of `"common.cuh"` suggests that this file relies on common CUDA utilities or definitions shared across multiple components of the application. The functionality provided by this file is relatively narrow, focusing specifically on the argsort operation within a CUDA context, and it is intended to be used in conjunction with other parts of a larger software system that processes or manipulates tensors.
# Functions

---
### ggml\_cuda\_op\_argsort
The function `ggml_cuda_op_argsort` performs an argsort operation on a tensor using CUDA.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A reference to a `ggml_backend_cuda_context` object, which provides the CUDA context for the operation.
    - `dst`: A pointer to a `ggml_tensor` object, which is the destination tensor where the sorted indices will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined to take two parameters: a CUDA context and a destination tensor.
    - It likely uses CUDA operations to perform an argsort on the data within the tensor.
    - The sorted indices are stored in the destination tensor `dst`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `dst` tensor in place to store the sorted indices.
