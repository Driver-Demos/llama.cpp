# Purpose
This code is a C/C++ header file designed to ensure compatibility with different versions of the CUDA toolkit. It includes several CUDA-related headers, such as `cuda_runtime.h`, `cuda.h`, and `cublas_v2.h`, which provide the necessary functions and definitions for CUDA programming. The file uses preprocessor directives to define macros that map certain CUDA attributes and types to alternative names if the CUDA Runtime version is below 11.2. This ensures that the code can be compiled and run on systems with older CUDA versions by providing backward compatibility for specific CUDA features and data types.
