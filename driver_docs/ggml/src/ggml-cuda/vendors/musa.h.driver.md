# Purpose
This C header file serves as a compatibility layer that maps NVIDIA CUDA and cuBLAS API functions and types to their corresponding MUSA (a hypothetical or alternative GPU computing platform) equivalents. By using preprocessor directives, it redefines CUDA and cuBLAS function names, data types, and constants to MUSA-specific implementations, facilitating the transition or interoperability between these two GPU computing environments. The file includes necessary MUSA headers and uses `#pragma once` to prevent multiple inclusions. This setup is particularly useful for developers who want to port CUDA-based applications to run on MUSA hardware without extensively modifying the original source code.
