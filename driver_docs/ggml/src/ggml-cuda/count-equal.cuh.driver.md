# Purpose
This code appears to be a header file, as it includes a function prototype and a macro definition but lacks a main function or any executable code. The file provides narrow functionality specific to CUDA operations, as indicated by the inclusion of "common.cuh" and the use of CUDA-specific terminology. The macro `CUDA_COUNT_EQUAL_CHUNK_SIZE` is defined, likely to be used as a constant value within CUDA operations. The function prototype `ggml_cuda_count_equal` suggests that the file is part of a larger library or framework designed to perform operations on tensors using CUDA, with the function likely intended to count or compare elements in a CUDA context.
# Functions

---
### ggml\_cuda\_count\_equal
The function `ggml_cuda_count_equal` counts the number of equal elements in a CUDA context and stores the result in a destination tensor.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A reference to a `ggml_backend_cuda_context` object, which represents the CUDA context in which the operation is performed.
    - `dst`: A pointer to a `ggml_tensor` object where the result of the count operation will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined to operate within a CUDA context, as indicated by the inclusion of 'common.cuh'.
    - The function takes a CUDA context and a destination tensor as inputs, suggesting it performs operations on data within the CUDA environment.
    - The macro `CUDA_COUNT_EQUAL_CHUNK_SIZE` is defined, likely used to determine the size of data chunks processed in parallel on the GPU.
    - The function's implementation is not provided, but it is expected to involve iterating over data in the CUDA context, counting equal elements, and storing the result in the destination tensor.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; instead, it modifies the `dst` tensor to store the count of equal elements.
