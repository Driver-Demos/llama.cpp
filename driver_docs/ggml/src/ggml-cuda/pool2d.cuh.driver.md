# Purpose
This code appears to be a header file for a CUDA-based library, providing a specific function related to 2D pooling operations on tensors. The inclusion of "common.cuh" suggests that it relies on shared CUDA utilities or definitions, indicating that it is part of a larger CUDA project. The definition of `CUDA_POOL2D_BLOCK_SIZE` as a macro suggests that this file is concerned with performance tuning, likely optimizing the block size for CUDA kernel execution. The function declaration `ggml_cuda_op_pool2d` implies that this file provides a narrow functionality focused on performing 2D pooling operations on tensors within a CUDA context, which is a common operation in neural network computations. Overall, this file is intended to be included in other source files that require GPU-accelerated pooling operations.
# Functions

---
### ggml\_cuda\_op\_pool2d
The function `ggml_cuda_op_pool2d` performs a 2D pooling operation on a tensor using CUDA.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A reference to a `ggml_backend_cuda_context` object, which likely contains the CUDA context and other necessary information for executing CUDA operations.
    - `dst`: A pointer to a `ggml_tensor` object, which represents the destination tensor where the result of the pooling operation will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined to take two parameters: a CUDA context and a destination tensor.
    - The function is likely to perform a 2D pooling operation on a tensor using CUDA, although the specific details of the operation are not provided in the code snippet.
    - The function does not return a value, indicating that the result of the operation is stored directly in the `dst` tensor.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `dst` tensor in place with the result of the 2D pooling operation.
