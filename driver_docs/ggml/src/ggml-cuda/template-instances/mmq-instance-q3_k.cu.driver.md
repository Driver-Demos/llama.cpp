# Purpose
This code file appears to be a part of a larger software project, specifically related to GPU-accelerated computations, as indicated by the inclusion of a CUDA header file (`mmq.cuh`). The file is auto-generated, suggesting it is part of a build process or a code generation step, and is not intended for manual editing. It provides narrow functionality by declaring a specific case (`DECL_MMQ_CASE(GGML_TYPE_Q3_K)`) for a type or operation defined elsewhere, likely in the included `mmq.cuh` file. This suggests that the file is part of a modular system where different cases or types are handled separately, possibly for performance optimization or code organization purposes.
