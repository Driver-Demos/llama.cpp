# Purpose
This source code file appears to be a CUDA header file that has been autogenerated, as indicated by the comment at the top. It provides narrow functionality by declaring a specific case for a function or macro, `DECL_FATTN_VEC_F32_CASE`, with parameters `128`, `GGML_TYPE_Q5_1`, and `GGML_TYPE_Q8_0`. The inclusion of `fattn-vec-f32.cuh` suggests that this file is part of a larger library or framework dealing with floating-point vector operations, likely optimized for GPU execution. The file is not intended to be edited manually, indicating that it is part of a build process or code generation pipeline, and is likely used to ensure consistent and efficient configuration of specific computational tasks within the broader software system.
