# Purpose
This source code file appears to be a CUDA header file that has been autogenerated, as indicated by the comment at the top. It is designed to declare multiple instances of a macro, `DECL_FATTN_MMA_F16_CASE`, with varying parameters, which suggests that it is part of a library or module focused on matrix multiplication or similar operations using half-precision floating-point (FP16) arithmetic. The inclusion of `fattn-mma-f16.cuh` indicates that this file is likely part of a larger framework or library for performing efficient matrix operations on NVIDIA GPUs, leveraging CUDA's capabilities. The file provides narrow functionality, specifically tailored for defining specific cases of matrix operations, and is intended to be included and used by other parts of the software rather than executed directly.
