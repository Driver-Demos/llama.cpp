# Purpose
This code file appears to be a CUDA header file, as indicated by the `.cuh` extension, and it is part of a larger system that deals with floating-point vector operations, specifically for a function or module named `fattn-vec-f32`. The file is autogenerated, suggesting it is part of a build process or a code generation system, and should not be manually edited. The primary functionality provided by this file is the declaration of a specific case for a function or macro `DECL_FATTN_VEC_F32_CASE`, which is likely used to handle operations involving 128-sized vectors with specific data types, `GGML_TYPE_Q5_0` and `GGML_TYPE_Q5_1`. This indicates that the file provides narrow functionality, focusing on a specific configuration or optimization for vector operations within a larger library or application.
