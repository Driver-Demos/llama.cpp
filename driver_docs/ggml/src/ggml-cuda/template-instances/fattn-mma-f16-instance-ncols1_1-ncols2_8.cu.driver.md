# Purpose
This source code file is an autogenerated CUDA header file, likely intended for use in a larger GPU-accelerated application. It provides narrow functionality by declaring multiple specialized cases of a function or macro, `DECL_FATTN_MMA_F16_CASE`, with varying parameters, which suggests it is part of a matrix multiplication or attention mechanism optimized for half-precision floating-point (F16) operations. The inclusion of `fattn-mma-f16.cuh` indicates that this file is part of a modular system where these declarations are used to instantiate specific configurations of a broader algorithm. The autogenerated nature of the file implies that it is not meant to be manually edited, but rather generated as part of a build process to optimize performance for specific matrix sizes.
