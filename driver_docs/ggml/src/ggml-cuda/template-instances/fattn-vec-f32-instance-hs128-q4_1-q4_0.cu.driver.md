# Purpose
This file appears to be a CUDA header file that has been autogenerated, likely as part of a larger codebase dealing with neural network operations or similar high-performance computing tasks. The file includes another header file, `fattn-vec-f32.cuh`, suggesting it is part of a library or module that deals with floating-point vector operations, possibly related to attention mechanisms in machine learning models. The macro `DECL_FATTN_VEC_F32_CASE` is used to declare a specific case for a function or operation, with parameters indicating data types and possibly vector sizes, which implies that this file is part of a broader system designed to handle various configurations of vector operations efficiently. The autogenerated nature of the file suggests it is not intended for manual editing, indicating that it is part of a build process that customizes or optimizes code for specific hardware or use cases.
