# Purpose
This code file appears to be a CUDA header file that has been autogenerated, as indicated by the comment at the top. It is designed to provide specific functionality related to a floating-point attention vector operation, likely in a machine learning or neural network context, given the use of "FATTN" (possibly short for "floating-point attention"). The file includes another header file, "fattn-vec-f16.cuh," suggesting it relies on definitions or functions declared there. The macro `DECL_FATTN_VEC_F16_CASE` is used to declare or define a specific case for a 64-element vector using half-precision floating-point (F16) and a quantized type (Q5_1), indicating that this file is part of a broader library or framework that supports various data types and configurations for attention mechanisms. This file is not intended to be executed directly but rather included in other parts of a larger software system.
