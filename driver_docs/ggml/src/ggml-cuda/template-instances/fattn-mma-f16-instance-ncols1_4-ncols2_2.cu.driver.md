# Purpose
This file is an autogenerated CUDA header file, likely intended to be included in other parts of a larger software project. It provides a narrow functionality by declaring multiple instances of a macro, `DECL_FATTN_MMA_F16_CASE`, with varying parameters, which suggests that it is setting up different configurations or cases for matrix multiplication operations using half-precision floating-point numbers (F16). The inclusion of another file, `fattn-mma-f16.cuh`, indicates that this file is part of a modular system where specific computational routines are defined elsewhere and this file serves to configure or instantiate them for specific use cases. The autogenerated nature of the file implies that it is part of a build process where such configurations are dynamically generated to optimize or tailor the software's performance for different scenarios.
