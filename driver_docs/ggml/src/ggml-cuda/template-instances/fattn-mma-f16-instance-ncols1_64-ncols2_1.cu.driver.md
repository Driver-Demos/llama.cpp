# Purpose
This source code file is an autogenerated CUDA header file, likely intended for use in GPU-accelerated applications. It provides a narrow functionality by declaring multiple specialized cases of a function or macro, `DECL_FATTN_MMA_F16_CASE`, with varying parameters, which suggests it is part of a library for matrix multiplication or similar operations using half-precision floating-point numbers (F16). The inclusion of the `fattn-mma-f16.cuh` file indicates that this file is part of a larger framework or library designed to optimize specific mathematical operations on NVIDIA GPUs. The autogenerated nature of the file implies that it is not meant to be manually edited, as it is likely generated to ensure consistency and correctness across different configurations or use cases.
