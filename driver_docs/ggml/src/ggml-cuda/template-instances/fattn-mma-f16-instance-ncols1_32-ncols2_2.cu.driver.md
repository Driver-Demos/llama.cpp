# Purpose
This file is an autogenerated CUDA header file, likely intended to be included in other parts of a larger software project. It provides a narrow functionality by declaring multiple instances of a macro, `DECL_FATTN_MMA_F16_CASE`, with specific parameters that suggest configurations for matrix multiplication operations using half-precision floating-point numbers (F16). The inclusion of `fattn-mma-f16.cuh` indicates that this file is part of a specialized library or module focused on fast attention mechanisms, possibly for machine learning or neural network computations. The autogenerated nature of the file suggests that it is part of a build process that dynamically generates code to optimize performance for different matrix sizes.
