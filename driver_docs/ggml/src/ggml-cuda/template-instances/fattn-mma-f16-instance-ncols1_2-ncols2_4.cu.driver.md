# Purpose
This file is an autogenerated CUDA header file, likely intended for use in a larger GPU-accelerated application. It provides a narrow functionality focused on defining specific cases for matrix multiplication operations using half-precision floating-point numbers (F16). The file includes another header file, "fattn-mma-f16.cuh," which suggests that it relies on pre-defined macros or functions to declare these matrix multiplication cases. The declarations such as `DECL_FATTN_MMA_F16_CASE` indicate that this file is part of a performance-optimized library, possibly for machine learning or scientific computing, where different matrix sizes (e.g., 64x64, 80x80) are pre-configured for efficient execution on compatible hardware.
