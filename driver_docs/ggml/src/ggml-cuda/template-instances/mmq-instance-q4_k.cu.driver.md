# Purpose
This code file appears to be an autogenerated CUDA header file, as indicated by the `.cuh` extension and the comment at the top. It is likely part of a larger system that involves GPU-accelerated computations, given the inclusion of another file, `mmq.cuh`, which suggests a focus on matrix-matrix operations or similar numerical tasks. The file provides narrow functionality, specifically declaring a macro or function case for a particular data type, `GGML_TYPE_Q4_K`, which is likely used in the context of the larger system for specialized processing or optimization tasks. The autogenerated nature of the file implies that it is part of a build process or a code generation step, ensuring that specific configurations or optimizations are consistently applied across different builds or deployments.
