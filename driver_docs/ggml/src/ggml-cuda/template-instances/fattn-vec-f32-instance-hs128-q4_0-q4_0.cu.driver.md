# Purpose
This code file appears to be a CUDA header file, as indicated by the ".cuh" extension, and it is part of a larger system that deals with floating-point vector operations, specifically for a function or module named "fattn-vec-f32". The file is autogenerated, suggesting it is part of a build process or a code generation system, and it should not be manually edited. The primary functionality provided by this file is the declaration of a specific case for a function or macro, `DECL_FATTN_VEC_F32_CASE`, which is parameterized with specific values (128, GGML_TYPE_Q4_0, GGML_TYPE_Q4_0). This suggests that the file is used to configure or optimize certain operations for specific data types or sizes, likely in a high-performance computing context where CUDA is used to leverage GPU acceleration.
