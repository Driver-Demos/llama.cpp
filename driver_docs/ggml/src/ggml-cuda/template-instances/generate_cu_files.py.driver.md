# Purpose
This Python script is a code generation utility designed to automate the creation of CUDA source files with specific configurations. It provides narrow functionality focused on generating `.cu` files for different configurations of vector and matrix operations, specifically for types and head sizes used in GPU-accelerated computations. The script defines several template strings for different CUDA file types and iterates over combinations of types, head sizes, and column configurations to produce these files. It uses the `glob` module to remove existing `.cu` files in the directory before generating new ones, ensuring that the output is fresh and consistent with the current configuration parameters. This script is particularly useful in environments where multiple configurations of CUDA operations need to be generated and maintained efficiently.

# Global Variables

---
### TYPES\_KV
- **Type**: `list`
- **Description**: `TYPES_KV` is a list of strings representing different types of quantization methods or formats used in the code. These types are likely related to some form of machine learning or data processing operations, as indicated by the naming convention (e.g., 'Q4', 'Q5', 'F16').
- **Use**: This variable is used to iterate over different quantization types when generating CUDA source files for various configurations.


---
### SOURCE\_FATTN\_VEC
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: `SOURCE_FATTN_VEC` is a string template for generating CUDA header files for vectorized attention operations. It includes a placeholder for the vector size (`vkq_size`) and declares a function case for a specific head size and data types (`type_k` and `type_v`).
- **Use**: This variable is used to format and write CUDA source files for different configurations of vectorized attention operations.


---
### SOURCE\_FATTN\_MMA\_START
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The variable `SOURCE_FATTN_MMA_START` is a string that contains a comment indicating that the file is autogenerated and includes a specific header file, `fattn-mma-f16.cuh`. This string is used as a template for generating CUDA source files.
- **Use**: This variable is used as a template to write the beginning part of CUDA source files for matrix multiplication operations.


---
### SOURCE\_FATTN\_MMA\_CASE
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: `SOURCE_FATTN_MMA_CASE` is a string template used to generate CUDA source code for matrix multiplication operations in a specific format. It includes placeholders for `head_size_kq`, `head_size_v`, `ncols1`, and `ncols2`, which are dynamically replaced with actual values during code generation.
- **Use**: This variable is used to format and write CUDA source code files for different configurations of matrix multiplication operations.


---
### TYPES\_MMQ
- **Type**: `list`
- **Description**: `TYPES_MMQ` is a list of strings, each representing a specific type identifier used in the context of the software. These identifiers are likely related to different quantization or data types used in machine learning or numerical computations, as suggested by the naming convention (e.g., 'Q4', 'Q5', 'IQ2').
- **Use**: This variable is used to iterate over different type identifiers to generate corresponding CUDA source files for each type.


---
### SOURCE\_MMQ
- **Type**: `str`
- **Description**: `SOURCE_MMQ` is a string variable that contains a template for generating CUDA source files. It includes a comment indicating that the file is autogenerated and should not be edited manually, and it includes a placeholder for a type that will be replaced during file generation.
- **Use**: This variable is used as a template to generate CUDA source files for different types defined in `TYPES_MMQ` by replacing the `{type}` placeholder with actual type values.


# Functions

---
### get\_short\_name<!-- {{#callable:llama.cpp/ggml/src/ggml-cuda/template-instances/generate_cu_files.get_short_name}} -->
The `get_short_name` function converts a long quantization type name to a short, lowercase version by removing the 'GGML_TYPE_' prefix.
- **Inputs**:
    - `long_quant_name`: A string representing the long quantization type name, which typically starts with the prefix 'GGML_TYPE_'.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes the input string `long_quant_name`.
    - It uses the `replace` method to remove the prefix 'GGML_TYPE_' from the input string.
    - The resulting string is then converted to lowercase using the `lower` method.
    - The function returns the modified string.
- **Output**: A string that is the short, lowercase version of the input quantization type name, with the 'GGML_TYPE_' prefix removed.


---
### get\_head\_sizes<!-- {{#callable:llama.cpp/ggml/src/ggml-cuda/template-instances/generate_cu_files.get_head_sizes}} -->
The `get_head_sizes` function returns a list of head sizes based on the provided types for keys and values.
- **Inputs**:
    - `type_k`: The type of the key, expected to be a string representing a specific GGML type.
    - `type_v`: The type of the value, expected to be a string representing a specific GGML type.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if both `type_k` and `type_v` are 'GGML_TYPE_F16'; if true, return the list [64, 128, 256].
    - Check if only `type_k` is 'GGML_TYPE_F16'; if true, return the list [64, 128].
    - If none of the above conditions are met, return the list [128].
- **Output**: A list of integers representing the head sizes, which can be [64, 128, 256], [64, 128], or [128] depending on the input types.
