# Purpose
This code file appears to be a CUDA header file that has been autogenerated, as indicated by the comment at the top. It provides narrow functionality by declaring a specific case for a function or macro related to floating-point vector operations, specifically for a 128-element vector using two custom data types, `GGML_TYPE_Q5_0` and `GGML_TYPE_Q4_1`. The inclusion of another file, `fattn-vec-f32.cuh`, suggests that this file is part of a larger library or framework designed for GPU-accelerated computations, likely involving neural networks or machine learning tasks. The file is not intended to be edited manually, indicating that it is part of a build process or code generation pipeline, which automates the creation of specialized computational routines.
