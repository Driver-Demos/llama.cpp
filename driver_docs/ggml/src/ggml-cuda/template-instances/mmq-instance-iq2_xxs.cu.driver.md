# Purpose
This source code file appears to be a part of a larger system, specifically serving as an autogenerated component that should not be manually edited. It includes a header file, `mmq.cuh`, suggesting that it is likely part of a CUDA-based application, possibly related to machine learning or numerical computations given the naming conventions. The file declares a macro or function `DECL_MMQ_CASE` with a specific type `GGML_TYPE_IQ2_XXS`, indicating that it is used to define or register a particular case or instance within a broader framework, likely for handling different data types or configurations. The narrow functionality and the autogenerated nature of the file suggest it is intended to be used as part of a compilation or build process, rather than being a standalone executable or library.
