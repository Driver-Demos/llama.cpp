# Purpose
This source code file appears to be a CUDA header file, as indicated by the `.cuh` extension, and it is part of a larger system that deals with floating-point vector operations, specifically for a function or module named `fattn-vec-f32`. The file is autogenerated, suggesting it is part of a build process or a code generation system, and should not be manually edited. The code provides narrow functionality, as it declares a specific case for a function or macro `DECL_FATTN_VEC_F32_CASE` with parameters that likely define a configuration or specialization for a particular operation involving 128 elements and two data types, `GGML_TYPE_Q8_0`. This setup is typically used in high-performance computing scenarios where specific optimizations are required for different data types or sizes.
