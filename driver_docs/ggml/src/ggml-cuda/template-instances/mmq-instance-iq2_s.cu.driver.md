# Purpose
This source code file appears to be a part of a larger project involving CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) programming, as indicated by the inclusion of a `.cuh` file, which is typically a CUDA header file. The file is autogenerated, suggesting it is part of a build process or a code generation step, and is not intended for manual editing. It provides narrow functionality by declaring a specific case, `DECL_MMQ_CASE(GGML_TYPE_IQ2_S);`, which likely relates to a particular data type or operation within a matrix-matrix multiplication (MMQ) context. This file is not an executable but rather a component that contributes to the broader functionality of a CUDA-based application, possibly involving specialized mathematical computations or optimizations.
