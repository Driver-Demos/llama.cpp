# Purpose
This code appears to be a CUDA header file that has been autogenerated, as indicated by the comment at the top. It includes another file, `mmq.cuh`, suggesting that it is part of a larger CUDA-based project, likely dealing with matrix or mathematical operations given the naming convention. The file declares a macro or function case, `DECL_MMQ_CASE(GGML_TYPE_Q6_K)`, which implies that it is setting up a specific case or configuration for a mathematical operation or data type, possibly related to quantization or a specific computation kernel. The functionality provided by this file is narrow, focusing on a specific type or case within the broader context of the project, and it is intended to be used as part of a larger compilation process rather than executed directly.
