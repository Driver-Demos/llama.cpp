# Purpose
This file is an autogenerated CUDA header file, likely intended for use in GPU-accelerated applications. It provides a narrow functionality focused on defining specific cases for matrix multiplication operations using half-precision floating-point numbers (F16). The file includes another header file, "fattn-mma-f16.cuh," and declares multiple instances of a macro, `DECL_FATTN_MMA_F16_CASE`, with varying matrix dimensions. This suggests that the file is part of a larger library or framework designed to optimize matrix operations for different sizes, enhancing performance in computational tasks such as deep learning or scientific computing. The autogenerated nature of the file indicates that it is part of a build process, where specific configurations are generated to match the needs of the application dynamically.
