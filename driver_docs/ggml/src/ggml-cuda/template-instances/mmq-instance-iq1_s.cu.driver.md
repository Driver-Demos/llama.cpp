# Purpose
This code file appears to be a CUDA header file that has been autogenerated, as indicated by the comment at the top. It includes another file, "mmq.cuh," suggesting that it is part of a larger CUDA-based project, likely dealing with matrix-matrix operations or similar computational tasks. The presence of the `DECL_MMQ_CASE(GGML_TYPE_IQ1_S);` macro indicates that this file is used to declare a specific case or instance of a matrix-matrix operation for a particular data type, `GGML_TYPE_IQ1_S`. This suggests that the file provides narrow functionality, focusing on a specific aspect of the broader computational capabilities of the project, and is intended to be used in conjunction with other files in the project rather than as a standalone executable.
