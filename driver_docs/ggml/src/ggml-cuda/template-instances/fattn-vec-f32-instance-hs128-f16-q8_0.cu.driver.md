# Purpose
This code file appears to be a CUDA header file that has been autogenerated, as indicated by the comment at the top. It provides narrow functionality, specifically related to the declaration of a function or macro for a particular case of a floating-point attention vector operation, likely used in machine learning or neural network computations. The file includes another header file, `fattn-vec-f32.cuh`, suggesting that it relies on definitions or implementations provided there. The `DECL_FATTN_VEC_F32_CASE` macro or function is defined for specific data types and dimensions, indicating that this file is part of a larger system that handles various configurations of attention vector operations. This file is not intended to be edited manually, as it is generated by a script, which implies it is part of a build process that customizes or optimizes code for specific hardware or application requirements.
