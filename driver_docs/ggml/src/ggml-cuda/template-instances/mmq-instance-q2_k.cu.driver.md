# Purpose
This code appears to be a CUDA header file that has been autogenerated, as indicated by the comment at the top. It includes another file, `mmq.cuh`, suggesting that it is part of a larger CUDA-based project, likely dealing with matrix or mathematical operations given the naming convention. The presence of `DECL_MMQ_CASE(GGML_TYPE_Q2_K);` suggests that this file is used to declare a specific case or instance of a template or function related to a type defined as `GGML_TYPE_Q2_K`. The file provides narrow functionality, likely serving as a specialized component within a broader system, and is intended to be included and used by other parts of the software rather than executed directly.
