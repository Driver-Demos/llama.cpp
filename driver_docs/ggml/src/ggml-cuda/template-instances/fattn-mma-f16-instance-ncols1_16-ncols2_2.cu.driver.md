# Purpose
This file is an autogenerated CUDA header file, likely intended for use in a larger GPU-accelerated application. It provides a narrow functionality focused on defining specific cases for matrix multiplication operations using half-precision floating-point (F16) arithmetic. The file includes another header file, "fattn-mma-f16.cuh," which suggests that it relies on predefined macros or functions from that file to declare various matrix multiplication cases with different dimensions. The use of macros like `DECL_FATTN_MMA_F16_CASE` indicates that this file is part of a templated or macro-based system to efficiently handle multiple configurations of matrix operations, likely for performance optimization in machine learning or scientific computing applications.
