# Purpose
This source code file appears to be an autogenerated CUDA header file, as indicated by the inclusion of a `.cuh` file and the use of macros for declaring functions or cases. The file is likely part of a larger library or framework that deals with matrix multiplication or similar operations using half-precision floating-point numbers (F16), as suggested by the naming convention `FATTN_MMA_F16`. The file provides narrow functionality, specifically defining multiple cases of a function or operation with varying parameters, which are likely used to optimize performance for different matrix sizes. The autogenerated nature of the file suggests it is not intended for manual editing, but rather to be included and used by other parts of the software that require these specific configurations for efficient computation.
