# Purpose
This file appears to be a CUDA header file that has been autogenerated, likely as part of a larger software project involving GPU-accelerated computations. The file includes another header file, `fattn-vec-f32.cuh`, suggesting that it is part of a library or module dealing with floating-point vector operations, possibly related to attention mechanisms in neural networks. The macro `DECL_FATTN_VEC_F32_CASE` is used to declare a specific case or configuration for these operations, with parameters indicating data types and possibly vector sizes or configurations. This file provides narrow functionality, focusing on a specific configuration of floating-point vector operations, and is intended to be included and used by other parts of the software rather than executed directly.
