# Purpose
This file is an autogenerated CUDA header file, likely intended to be included in other parts of a larger software project. It provides a narrow but specific functionality by declaring multiple instances of a macro, `DECL_FATTN_MMA_F16_CASE`, with varying parameters. These declarations suggest that the file is part of a matrix multiplication or attention mechanism implementation using half-precision floating-point (F16) operations, optimized for different matrix sizes. The inclusion of another file, `fattn-mma-f16.cuh`, indicates that this file relies on definitions or implementations provided elsewhere, and its autogenerated nature suggests it is part of a build process that customizes or optimizes code for specific hardware configurations or performance requirements.
