# Purpose
This code file appears to be a CUDA header file that has been autogenerated, as indicated by the comment at the top. It provides narrow functionality by declaring a specific case for a macro or function, `DECL_MMQ_CASE`, with the parameter `GGML_TYPE_IQ3_XXS`. This suggests that the file is part of a larger system, likely related to matrix multiplication or a similar mathematical operation, given the inclusion of `mmq.cuh`, which is presumably a CUDA header file for matrix operations. The file is not intended to be executed directly but rather to be included in other parts of a program, serving as a configuration or setup file for specific computational cases within a broader CUDA-based application.
