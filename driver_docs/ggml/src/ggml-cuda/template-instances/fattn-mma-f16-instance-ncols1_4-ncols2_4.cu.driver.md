# Purpose
This source code file appears to be a CUDA header file that has been autogenerated, as indicated by the comment at the top. It is designed to declare multiple specialized cases of a function or macro, `DECL_FATTN_MMA_F16_CASE`, with varying parameters, likely for matrix multiplication or a similar operation involving half-precision floating-point numbers (F16). The file provides narrow functionality, focusing specifically on defining these cases for different matrix sizes, which suggests it is part of a larger library or framework for GPU-accelerated computations. The inclusion of another file, `fattn-mma-f16.cuh`, indicates that this file is intended to be used in conjunction with other components, likely as part of a performance-optimized mathematical or machine learning library.
