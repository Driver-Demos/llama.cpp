# Purpose
This source code file is an OpenCL kernel implementation designed to perform element-wise division operations on data arrays. The file contains two kernel functions: `kernel_div` and `kernel_div_row`. These functions are intended to be executed on a parallel computing device, such as a GPU, to leverage the computational power of such hardware for efficient data processing. The code is structured to handle division operations on multi-dimensional data arrays, with the ability to offset into the data arrays and handle broadcasting of smaller arrays across larger ones.

The `kernel_div` function is a general-purpose kernel that divides elements from two source arrays (`src0` and `src1`) and stores the result in a destination array (`dst`). It uses OpenCL's work-group and work-item concepts to distribute the computation across multiple processing units. The function supports multi-dimensional data by using offsets and strides (`nb00`, `nb01`, etc.) to navigate through the data arrays. The division operation is performed on `float` data types, and the function is designed to handle complex indexing to accommodate various data shapes and sizes.

The `kernel_div_row` function is a specialized version of the division operation, optimized for cases where the second source array (`src1`) is a single row that needs to be broadcast across the first source array (`src0`). This function uses `float4` data types for potentially improved performance through vectorized operations. The function calculates the appropriate index for `src1` using a more efficient method than the modulus operation, which can be beneficial for performance in high-throughput scenarios. Overall, this file provides specialized functionality for performing efficient, parallelized division operations on large datasets in a high-performance computing context.
# Functions

---
### kernel\_div
The `kernel_div` function performs element-wise division of two multi-dimensional arrays in parallel using OpenCL, with broadcasting support for the second array.
- **Inputs**:
    - `src0`: A global pointer to the first source array, which is the dividend.
    - `offset0`: An offset in bytes to be added to the src0 pointer.
    - `src1`: A global pointer to the second source array, which is the divisor.
    - `offset1`: An offset in bytes to be added to the src1 pointer.
    - `dst`: A global pointer to the destination array where the result of the division will be stored.
    - `offsetd`: An offset in bytes to be added to the dst pointer.
    - `nb00, nb01, nb02, nb03`: Byte strides for navigating through the dimensions of src0.
    - `ne10, ne11, ne12, ne13`: Sizes of the dimensions for src1, used for broadcasting.
    - `nb10, nb11, nb12, nb13`: Byte strides for navigating through the dimensions of src1.
    - `ne0`: Size of the first dimension of the arrays.
    - `nb0, nb1, nb2, nb3`: Byte strides for navigating through the dimensions of dst.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Adjust the pointers src0, src1, and dst by their respective offsets.
    - Retrieve the group IDs for the third, second, and first dimensions using `get_group_id`.
    - Calculate indices for src1 using modulo operations to support broadcasting.
    - Compute pointers for src0, src1, and dst based on the group IDs and byte strides.
    - Iterate over the first dimension using `get_local_id` and `get_local_size` to parallelize the operation.
    - Perform element-wise division of the corresponding elements from src0 and src1, storing the result in dst.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it writes the result of the division into the destination array `dst`.

### kernel\_div\_row
The `kernel_div_row` function performs element-wise division of a global array `src0` by a row vector `src1`, storing the result in `dst`, optimized for OpenCL execution.
- **Inputs**:
    - `src0`: A global pointer to the input array of type `float4` that will be divided by `src1`.
    - `offset0`: An offset in bytes to be added to `src0` to get the starting point for the operation.
    - `src1`: A global pointer to the row vector of type `float4` that will be used to divide `src0`.
    - `offset1`: An offset in bytes to be added to `src1` to get the starting point for the operation.
    - `dst`: A global pointer to the output array of type `float4` where the result of the division will be stored.
    - `offsetd`: An offset in bytes to be added to `dst` to get the starting point for storing the result.
    - `ne`: An integer representing the number of elements in the row vector `src1`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Adjust the pointers `src0`, `src1`, and `dst` by adding their respective offsets to point to the correct starting positions.
    - Calculate the global ID `gid` for the current work item using `get_global_id(0)`.
    - Compute the index `idx1` for accessing `src1` by calculating `gid - (gid/ne)*ne`, which is equivalent to `gid % ne`.
    - Perform element-wise division of `src0[gid]` by `src1[idx1]` and store the result in `dst[gid]`.
- **Output**: The function outputs the result of the element-wise division of `src0` by `src1` into the `dst` array, with each element being a `float4`.
