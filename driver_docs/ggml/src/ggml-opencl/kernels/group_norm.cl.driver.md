# Purpose
This source code file is an OpenCL kernel implementation designed to perform group normalization on a set of input data. The code is structured to leverage specific hardware capabilities by enabling various OpenCL extensions, such as `cl_khr_fp16` for half-precision floating-point operations and subgroup-related extensions for Intel and Qualcomm GPUs. The kernel, named `kernel_group_norm`, is responsible for normalizing input data (`src0`) and writing the normalized results to an output buffer (`dst`). The normalization process involves calculating the mean and variance of the data within specified groups and then scaling the data accordingly.

The code includes conditional compilation directives to enable different OpenCL extensions based on the target GPU architecture, either Intel or Qualcomm. This is achieved through preprocessor directives that define macros for subgroup sizes and GPU identification. The kernel function itself is designed to operate on a workgroup level, where each workgroup processes a segment of the input data. The function calculates the mean and variance of the data within each group, then normalizes the data by adjusting each element based on these statistics.

Overall, this file provides a specialized functionality focused on group normalization, which is a common operation in machine learning and data processing tasks. The use of OpenCL extensions and subgroup operations indicates an optimization for parallel processing on specific GPU architectures, enhancing performance by utilizing hardware-specific features. The kernel is intended to be executed on a compatible OpenCL device, making it a crucial component in applications that require efficient data normalization across large datasets.
# Functions

---
### kernel\_group\_norm
The `kernel_group_norm` function performs group normalization on a segment of a global float array using OpenCL subgroups.
- **Inputs**:
    - `src0`: A global float pointer to the source data array.
    - `offset0`: An unsigned long integer representing the offset to be applied to the source data pointer.
    - `dst`: A global float pointer to the destination data array where the normalized values will be stored.
    - `offsetd`: An unsigned long integer representing the offset to be applied to the destination data pointer.
    - `ne`: An integer representing the total number of elements in the source data array.
    - `group_size`: An integer representing the size of the group for normalization.
    - `eps`: A float value representing a small epsilon to prevent division by zero during normalization.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Adjust the source and destination pointers by their respective offsets.
    - Calculate the start and end indices for the current workgroup based on the group ID and group size.
    - Adjust the start index by the local ID to ensure each work item processes a unique segment.
    - Check if the end index exceeds the total number of elements and adjust if necessary.
    - Initialize a temporary float variable to accumulate the sum of elements in the current segment.
    - Iterate over the segment, summing the elements and using subgroup reduction to compute the total sum.
    - Calculate the mean of the segment by dividing the total sum by the group size.
    - Reinitialize the temporary variable to accumulate the sum of squared differences from the mean.
    - Iterate over the segment again, computing the difference from the mean, storing it in the destination array, and accumulating the squared differences.
    - Use subgroup reduction to compute the total sum of squared differences.
    - Calculate the variance and the scaling factor using the variance and epsilon.
    - Iterate over the segment a final time, scaling each element in the destination array by the scaling factor.
- **Output**: The function outputs the normalized values in the destination array `dst`, with each element adjusted to have zero mean and unit variance within its group.
