# Purpose
This source code file is an OpenCL kernel implementation designed to perform a bitonic sort on a set of floating-point numbers. The kernel, named `kernel_argsort_f32_i32`, sorts an array of 32-bit floating-point numbers (`float`) and outputs the sorted indices into a destination array of 32-bit integers (`int`). The sorting can be performed in either ascending or descending order, as specified by the `order` parameter, which uses an enumeration `ggml_sort_order` to define the sort order. The kernel leverages local memory and synchronization barriers to efficiently perform the sorting operation in parallel across multiple work-items.

The file includes several preprocessor directives to enable specific OpenCL extensions, such as `cl_khr_fp16` for half-precision floating-point support and conditional enabling of subgroup extensions based on the target GPU architecture (Intel or Qualcomm Adreno). These extensions and conditional definitions allow the kernel to be optimized for different hardware capabilities, such as specifying required subgroup sizes for execution. The use of macros like `SWAP` facilitates the swapping of elements during the sorting process, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

Overall, this file provides a specialized functionality focused on sorting operations within an OpenCL context, making it suitable for use in applications that require efficient parallel sorting on compatible GPU hardware. The kernel is designed to be integrated into larger systems where sorting of floating-point data is a performance-critical task, and it is adaptable to different hardware configurations through its use of conditional compilation and extension pragmas.
# Data Structures

---
### ggml\_sort\_order
- **Type**: `enum`
- **Members**:
    - `GGML_SORT_ORDER_ASC`: Represents ascending sort order.
    - `GGML_SORT_ORDER_DESC`: Represents descending sort order.
- **Description**: The `ggml_sort_order` is an enumeration that defines two possible sorting orders: ascending and descending. It is used to specify the order in which elements should be sorted, particularly in the context of the `kernel_argsort_f32_i32` function, which performs a bitonic sort on floating-point data. The enumeration provides a clear and concise way to indicate the desired sorting direction within sorting algorithms.


# Functions

---
### kernel\_argsort\_f32\_i32
The `kernel_argsort_f32_i32` function performs a bitonic sort on a row of floating-point numbers and stores the sorted indices in an integer array.
- **Inputs**:
    - `src0`: A global pointer to the source array of floating-point numbers to be sorted.
    - `offset0`: An unsigned long integer representing the byte offset to be applied to the source array pointer.
    - `dst`: A global pointer to the destination array where sorted indices will be stored.
    - `offsetd`: An unsigned long integer representing the byte offset to be applied to the destination array pointer.
    - `ne00`: An integer representing the number of elements in each row of the source array to be sorted.
    - `ne00_pad`: An integer representing the padded number of elements in each row, used for alignment in sorting.
    - `order`: An integer representing the sort order, either ascending or descending, as defined by the `ggml_sort_order` enum.
    - `dst_row`: A local pointer to an integer array used to store indices during the sorting process.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the local column index and group row index using OpenCL functions.
    - Check if the current column index exceeds the padded number of elements; if so, exit the function early.
    - Adjust the source and destination pointers by their respective offsets.
    - Initialize the `dst_row` array with column indices.
    - Use a barrier to synchronize local memory before starting the sort.
    - Perform a bitonic sort using nested loops, swapping indices based on the specified order and conditions.
    - Use barriers to ensure synchronization between threads during sorting.
    - Copy the sorted indices from `dst_row` to the `dst` array, excluding any padding.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but modifies the `dst` array to contain the sorted indices of the `src0` array.
