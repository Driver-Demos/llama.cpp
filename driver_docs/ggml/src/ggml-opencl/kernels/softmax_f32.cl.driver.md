# Purpose
This source code file is an OpenCL kernel implementation designed to perform a softmax operation on a set of input data. The code is structured to leverage specific hardware capabilities, such as subgroups, to optimize performance on different GPU architectures, including Intel and Qualcomm's Adreno GPUs. The file begins by enabling relevant OpenCL extensions, which are conditional based on the presence of certain preprocessor definitions. This allows the kernel to adapt to different hardware features, such as subgroup sizes, which are crucial for efficient parallel computation.

The primary functionality of the code is encapsulated in the `kernel_soft_max` function, which is a kernel function intended to be executed on a GPU. This function takes multiple parameters, including pointers to input and output data, offsets, dimensions, and scaling factors. The kernel computes the softmax function, which is a common operation in machine learning, particularly in neural networks, where it is used to convert a vector of raw scores into probabilities. The implementation includes optimizations such as parallel reduction to compute the maximum value and the sum of exponentials, which are key steps in the softmax calculation. The use of subgroup operations like `sub_group_reduce_max` and `sub_group_reduce_add` indicates an emphasis on maximizing parallel efficiency.

Overall, this file provides a specialized and optimized implementation of the softmax operation for use in GPU-accelerated environments. It is tailored to exploit specific hardware features to achieve high performance, making it suitable for applications in high-performance computing and machine learning. The code is not a standalone executable but rather a component that would be integrated into a larger system, likely as part of a library or framework that handles GPU computations.
# Functions

---
### kernel\_soft\_max
The `kernel_soft_max` function computes the softmax of a given input tensor with optional masking and scaling, using parallel processing on a GPU.
- **Inputs**:
    - `src0`: A global pointer to the input tensor data.
    - `offset0`: An offset in bytes to be added to the `src0` pointer.
    - `src1`: A global pointer to the mask tensor data, or the same as `src0` if no mask is used.
    - `offset1`: An offset in bytes to be added to the `src1` pointer.
    - `dst`: A global pointer to the output tensor data.
    - `offsetd`: An offset in bytes to be added to the `dst` pointer.
    - `ne00`: The size of the first dimension of the input tensor.
    - `ne01`: The size of the second dimension of the input tensor.
    - `ne02`: The size of the third dimension of the input tensor.
    - `scale`: A scaling factor applied to the input tensor values.
    - `max_bias`: A bias value used to determine if ALiBi (Attention Linear Bias) should be applied.
    - `m0`: The base value for ALiBi when the head index is less than `n_head_log2`.
    - `m1`: The base value for ALiBi when the head index is greater than or equal to `n_head_log2`.
    - `n_head_log2`: The logarithm base 2 of the number of attention heads, used to determine ALiBi parameters.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Adjusts the input, mask, and output pointers by their respective offsets.
    - Determines the group and local IDs for parallel processing.
    - Calculates the slope for ALiBi if `max_bias` is greater than zero, using different bases and exponents depending on the head index.
    - Performs a parallel reduction to find the maximum value of the scaled and optionally masked input tensor.
    - Computes the exponentials of the scaled and optionally masked input tensor values, subtracting the maximum value for numerical stability, and stores these in the output tensor.
    - Performs a parallel reduction to compute the sum of the exponentials.
    - Normalizes the output tensor by dividing each element by the sum of the exponentials.
- **Output**: The function outputs the softmax values of the input tensor into the `dst` pointer, with optional masking and scaling applied.
