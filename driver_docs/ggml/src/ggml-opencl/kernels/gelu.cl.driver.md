# Purpose
This source code file is an OpenCL implementation that provides a set of kernel functions for computing the Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) activation function, which is commonly used in neural networks. The file defines four kernel functions: `kernel_gelu`, `kernel_gelu_4`, `kernel_gelu_quick`, and `kernel_gelu_quick_4`. These functions are designed to operate on arrays of floating-point numbers, with the `kernel_gelu` and `kernel_gelu_quick` functions processing single floats, and the `kernel_gelu_4` and `kernel_gelu_quick_4` functions processing vectors of four floats (`float4`). This distinction allows for optimized processing of data in parallel, leveraging the capabilities of OpenCL for high-performance computing.

The file begins by enabling the `cl_khr_fp16` extension, which suggests that the code may be optimized for half-precision floating-point operations, although the current implementation uses single-precision floats. The constants `GELU_COEF_A`, `GELU_QUICK_COEF`, and `SQRT_2_OVER_PI` are defined to facilitate the computation of the GELU function. The `kernel_gelu` and `kernel_gelu_4` functions implement the standard GELU activation using a mathematical approximation involving the hyperbolic tangent function. In contrast, the `kernel_gelu_quick` and `kernel_gelu_quick_4` functions provide a faster approximation using an exponential function, which may be beneficial in scenarios where computational efficiency is prioritized over precision.

Overall, this file is a specialized library intended for use in machine learning applications where the GELU activation function is required. It provides both standard and quick approximations of the GELU function, allowing developers to choose between accuracy and performance based on their specific needs. The use of OpenCL kernels indicates that this code is designed to be executed on a variety of hardware platforms, including GPUs, to take advantage of parallel processing capabilities.

# Functions

---
### kernel\_gelu
The `kernel_gelu` function applies the Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) activation function to each element of a global float array, with an offset applied to both the source and destination arrays.
- **Inputs**:
    - `src0`: A global float pointer to the source array from which input values are read.
    - `offset0`: An unsigned long integer representing the byte offset to be applied to the source array pointer.
    - `dst`: A global float pointer to the destination array where the output values are written.
    - `offsetd`: An unsigned long integer representing the byte offset to be applied to the destination array pointer.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Adjust the `src0` pointer by adding `offset0` to it, effectively moving the pointer to the correct starting position in the source array.
    - Adjust the `dst` pointer by adding `offsetd` to it, effectively moving the pointer to the correct starting position in the destination array.
    - Retrieve the current element `x` from the source array using the global ID as the index.
    - Compute the GELU activation for `x` using the formula `0.5f*x*(1.0f + tanh(SQRT_2_OVER_PI*x*(1.0f + GELU_COEF_A*x*x)))`.
    - Store the computed GELU value in the destination array at the position indicated by the global ID.
