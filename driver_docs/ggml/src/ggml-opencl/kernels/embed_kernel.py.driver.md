# Purpose
This Python script provides a narrow functionality focused on embedding the contents of an input file into a C++-style raw string literal format and writing it to an output file. It is a short script that uses command-line arguments to specify the input and output file paths, ensuring that exactly two arguments are provided. The script reads each line from the input file, formats it into a raw string literal, and writes it to the output file, which is useful for embedding OpenCL kernel code or other text data directly into C++ source code. Logging is used to provide usage instructions if the arguments are incorrect, enhancing user guidance.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `sys`
- `logging`


# Global Variables

---
### logger
- **Type**: `logging.Logger`
- **Description**: The `logger` variable is an instance of a Logger object from the logging module, configured to handle logging messages for the 'opencl-embed-kernel' component. It is used to log informational messages, particularly for usage instructions when the script is executed with incorrect arguments.
- **Use**: This variable is used to log messages to the console, providing feedback to the user about the script's usage.


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:llama.cpp/ggml/src/ggml-opencl/kernels/embed_kernel.main}} -->
The `main` function reads an input file and writes its contents to an output file, wrapping each line in a specific format, while also handling basic command-line argument validation and logging.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Set up basic logging configuration with INFO level.
    - Check if the number of command-line arguments is exactly 3; if not, log usage information and exit the program.
    - Open the input file specified by the first command-line argument for reading.
    - Open the output file specified by the second command-line argument for writing.
    - Iterate over each line in the input file, format it by wrapping it in 'R"({})"' and write it to the output file.
    - Close both the input and output files after processing.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs file I/O operations and logs information to the console.
