# Purpose
This source code file is an OpenCL implementation that provides a set of kernels for performing operations related to the "YaRN" algorithm, which is based on the LlamaYaRNScaledRotaryEmbedding.py from a GitHub repository. The code is designed to handle various types of data, including both 32-bit and 16-bit floating-point numbers, and it is structured to perform complex mathematical transformations on input data using rotational and scaling techniques. The primary purpose of these kernels is to apply a form of rotary positional encoding, which is a technique used in machine learning models to incorporate positional information into data, particularly in the context of attention mechanisms.

The file contains several kernel functions, each tailored to specific data types and use cases, such as `kernel_rope_norm_f32`, `kernel_rope_norm_f16`, `kernel_rope_neox_f32`, `kernel_rope_neox_f16`, `kernel_rope_multi_f32`, `kernel_rope_multi_f16`, `kernel_rope_vision_f32`, and `kernel_rope_vision_f16`. These kernels are responsible for processing input data arrays, applying rotational transformations using trigonometric functions (cosine and sine), and adjusting the data based on frequency scaling and correction dimensions. The kernels utilize helper functions like `rope_yarn`, `rope_yarn_ramp`, `rope_yarn_corr_factor`, and `rope_yarn_corr_dims` to compute necessary parameters for the transformations.

Overall, this code provides a specialized and narrow functionality focused on enhancing data with positional encoding through rotational transformations. It is intended to be executed on a parallel computing platform using OpenCL, making it suitable for high-performance applications in machine learning and data processing. The code defines internal functions and does not expose public APIs or external interfaces, as it is designed to be integrated into a larger system where these kernels are invoked as part of a computational pipeline.
