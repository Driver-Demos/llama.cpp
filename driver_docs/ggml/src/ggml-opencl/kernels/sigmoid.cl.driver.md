# Purpose
This source code file is an OpenCL kernel implementation that provides functionality for computing the sigmoid function on arrays of floating-point numbers. The file defines two kernel functions: `kernel_sigmoid_f32` and `kernel_sigmoid_f16`. These functions are designed to operate on arrays of 32-bit floats and 16-bit half-precision floats, respectively. The primary purpose of these kernels is to apply the sigmoid activation function, which is commonly used in neural networks and other machine learning applications, to each element of the input array.

The code utilizes OpenCL's parallel computing capabilities to efficiently compute the sigmoid function across potentially large datasets. Each kernel function takes pointers to global memory locations for the source and destination arrays, along with offsets to correctly position the data. The use of `get_global_id(0)` allows the kernels to process each element of the array in parallel, leveraging the hardware's ability to execute multiple threads simultaneously. This parallelism is crucial for performance in high-computation environments such as GPU-accelerated machine learning tasks.

The file is a collection of related components focused on the theme of applying the sigmoid function to data arrays. It does not define a public API or external interface but rather provides low-level computational kernels that can be invoked by higher-level code managing the OpenCL context and command queues. The inclusion of the `#pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_khr_fp16 : enable` directive indicates that the code is prepared to handle half-precision floating-point operations, which can be beneficial for performance and memory usage in certain applications.
# Functions

---
### kernel\_sigmoid\_f32
The `kernel_sigmoid_f32` function applies the sigmoid activation function to each element of a float array in parallel using OpenCL.
- **Inputs**:
    - `src0`: A global pointer to the input float array.
    - `offset0`: An unsigned long integer representing the byte offset to be applied to the input array pointer.
    - `dst`: A global pointer to the output float array where results will be stored.
    - `offsetd`: An unsigned long integer representing the byte offset to be applied to the output array pointer.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Adjust the `src0` pointer by adding the `offset0` to point to the correct starting position in the input array.
    - Adjust the `dst` pointer by adding the `offsetd` to point to the correct starting position in the output array.
    - For each element in the input array, compute the sigmoid function `1.0f / (1.0f + exp(-x))` where `x` is the current element, and store the result in the corresponding position in the output array.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but writes the computed sigmoid values to the `dst` array.

### kernel\_sigmoid\_f16
The `kernel_sigmoid_f16` function applies the sigmoid activation function to each element of a half-precision floating-point input array and stores the result in an output array.
- **Inputs**:
    - `src0`: A global pointer to the input array of half-precision floating-point numbers.
    - `offset0`: An unsigned long integer representing the byte offset to be applied to the input array pointer.
    - `dst`: A global pointer to the output array where the results will be stored, also in half-precision floating-point format.
    - `offsetd`: An unsigned long integer representing the byte offset to be applied to the output array pointer.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Adjusts the input pointer `src0` by adding the byte offset `offset0`.
    - Adjusts the output pointer `dst` by adding the byte offset `offsetd`.
    - For each element in the input array, identified by `get_global_id(0)`, computes the sigmoid function `1.0f / (1.0f + exp(-src0[get_global_id(0)]))`.
    - Stores the computed sigmoid value in the corresponding position in the output array `dst`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but writes the sigmoid-transformed values to the `dst` array.
