# Purpose
This source code file contains two OpenCL kernel functions, `kernel_diag_mask_inf` and `kernel_diag_mask_inf_8`, which are designed to perform operations on matrices or multi-dimensional arrays. The primary purpose of these kernels is to apply a masking operation that sets certain elements of the destination array to negative infinity based on a condition involving the indices of the elements. This operation is typically used in machine learning and numerical computing to mask out certain parts of a matrix, such as in attention mechanisms where future time steps are masked in sequence models.

The `kernel_diag_mask_inf` function operates on arrays of single-precision floating-point numbers (`float`), while `kernel_diag_mask_inf_8` is optimized for processing arrays of `float4` vectors, which allows for more efficient data handling by leveraging vectorized operations. Both kernels take as input pointers to the source and destination arrays, along with offsets and dimensions that define the structure of the data. The kernels use these parameters to calculate the appropriate indices and apply the masking condition, which is determined by the `n_past` parameter and the current indices of the elements.

These kernels are part of a broader computational framework that utilizes OpenCL for parallel processing on heterogeneous platforms, such as GPUs. The use of OpenCL extensions, such as `cl_khr_fp16`, indicates that the code is designed to take advantage of specific hardware capabilities for improved performance. The file is likely a component of a larger library or application that requires efficient matrix operations, particularly in contexts where certain elements need to be selectively ignored or masked during computation.
# Functions

---
### kernel\_diag\_mask\_inf
The function `kernel_diag_mask_inf` modifies a destination array by setting certain elements to negative infinity based on a condition involving past elements and indices.
- **Inputs**:
    - `src0`: A global pointer to the source array of floats.
    - `offset0`: An unsigned long integer representing the offset to be applied to the source array pointer.
    - `dst`: A global pointer to the destination array of floats.
    - `offsetd`: An unsigned long integer representing the offset to be applied to the destination array pointer.
    - `ne00`: An integer representing the size of the first dimension of the arrays.
    - `ne01`: An integer representing the size of the second dimension of the arrays.
    - `n_past`: An integer representing the number of past elements to consider for masking.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Adjust the `src0` and `dst` pointers by adding their respective offsets.
    - Retrieve the global IDs for the third, second, and first dimensions using `get_global_id` function.
    - Check if the current index `i00` is greater than `n_past + i01`.
    - If true, set the corresponding element in `dst` to negative infinity.
    - If false, copy the corresponding element from `src0` to `dst`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `dst` array in place.

### kernel\_diag\_mask\_inf\_8
The function `kernel_diag_mask_inf_8` applies a diagonal masking operation on a 4-element float vector array, setting certain elements to negative infinity based on their indices and a past threshold.
- **Inputs**:
    - `src0`: A global pointer to the source array of float4 elements.
    - `offset0`: An unsigned long integer representing the byte offset to be applied to the source array pointer.
    - `dst`: A global pointer to the destination array of float4 elements.
    - `offsetd`: An unsigned long integer representing the byte offset to be applied to the destination array pointer.
    - `ne00`: An integer representing the size of the first dimension of the array.
    - `ne01`: An integer representing the size of the second dimension of the array.
    - `n_past`: An integer representing the threshold index for applying the mask.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Adjust the pointers `src0` and `dst` by adding their respective offsets.
    - Calculate the global index `i` based on the global ID of the first dimension, scaled by 2.
    - Copy two float4 elements from `src0` to `dst` at indices `i` and `i+1`.
    - Calculate the indices `i02`, `i01`, and `i00` based on the global index `i` and the dimensions `ne00` and `ne01`.
    - Iterate over the last four elements of the float4 vector, checking if their indices exceed the threshold `n_past + i01`.
    - Set elements to `-INFINITY` if their indices exceed the threshold, breaking the loop early if a condition is met.
- **Output**: The function modifies the `dst` array in place, setting certain elements to `-INFINITY` based on their calculated indices and the `n_past` threshold.
