# Purpose
The provided code is a kernel function written in OpenCL, designed to execute on a parallel computing device such as a GPU. The function, `kernel_sum_rows_f32`, performs a specific operation: it calculates the sum of elements in each row of a multi-dimensional array and stores the result in a corresponding position in a destination array. This operation is performed in parallel across multiple rows, leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of the hardware to improve performance.

The kernel function takes several parameters, including pointers to the source and destination arrays (`src0` and `dst`), offsets for these arrays (`offset0` and `offsetd`), and dimensions and strides for navigating the arrays (`ne00`, `ne01`, `ne02`, `ne03`, `nb01`, `nb02`, `nb03`, `nb1`, `nb2`, `nb3`). The function uses these parameters to correctly index into the arrays and perform the row summation. The use of `get_global_id` allows the function to determine the specific row it should process, ensuring that each work item in the parallel execution environment handles a different row.

This code is a specialized component intended for use in applications that require efficient computation of row sums in large datasets, such as in scientific computing or machine learning tasks. It does not define a public API or external interface but is likely part of a larger library or application where it is invoked as part of a broader data processing pipeline. The focus on parallel execution and the use of OpenCL suggest that performance optimization is a key consideration in its design.
# Functions

---
### kernel\_sum\_rows\_f32
The function `kernel_sum_rows_f32` computes the sum of each row in a 4D array and stores the result in a destination array.
- **Inputs**:
    - `src0`: A pointer to the source 4D array of floats.
    - `offset0`: An offset in bytes to adjust the starting position of the source array.
    - `dst`: A pointer to the destination array where the row sums will be stored.
    - `offsetd`: An offset in bytes to adjust the starting position of the destination array.
    - `ne00`: The size of the first dimension of the source array, representing the number of elements in each row.
    - `ne01`: The size of the second dimension of the source array.
    - `ne02`: The size of the third dimension of the source array.
    - `ne03`: The size of the fourth dimension of the source array.
    - `nb01`: The byte stride between elements in the first dimension of the source array.
    - `nb02`: The byte stride between elements in the second dimension of the source array.
    - `nb03`: The byte stride between elements in the third dimension of the source array.
    - `nb1`: The byte stride between elements in the first dimension of the destination array.
    - `nb2`: The byte stride between elements in the second dimension of the destination array.
    - `nb3`: The byte stride between elements in the third dimension of the destination array.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Adjust the pointers `src0` and `dst` by their respective offsets `offset0` and `offsetd`.
    - Retrieve the global indices `i3`, `i2`, and `i1` for the current work item.
    - Check if the indices `i3`, `i2`, or `i1` exceed their respective dimensions `ne03`, `ne02`, or `ne01`; if so, exit the function.
    - Calculate the starting address of the current row in both the source and destination arrays using the indices and byte strides.
    - Initialize a variable `row_sum` to zero to accumulate the sum of the current row.
    - Iterate over the first dimension `ne00` to sum up the elements of the current row in the source array.
    - Store the computed `row_sum` in the first element of the corresponding row in the destination array.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it writes the sum of each row to the destination array.
