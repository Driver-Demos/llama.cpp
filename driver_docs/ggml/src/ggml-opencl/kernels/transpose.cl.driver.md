# Purpose
This source code file contains OpenCL kernels designed for performing matrix transpositions on image buffers. The file defines three distinct kernels: `kernel_transpose_16`, `kernel_transpose_32`, and `kernel_transpose_32_16`. Each kernel is responsible for transposing a 4x4 tile of elements from an input buffer to an output buffer, with variations in data type and additional functionality. The kernels utilize OpenCL's image buffer capabilities to efficiently handle data in parallel, leveraging the GPU's architecture for high-performance computation.

The `kernel_transpose_16` function handles 16-bit floating-point data, using the `half4` data type to read and write 4-element vectors. It reads a 4x4 tile from the input buffer and writes the transposed tile to the output buffer. Similarly, `kernel_transpose_32` operates on 32-bit floating-point data, using the `float4` data type. Both kernels use the `get_global_id` function to determine the global work-item IDs, which are used to calculate the appropriate indices for reading and writing data.

The `kernel_transpose_32_16` function is specialized for handling activations and includes additional functionality. It reads 32-bit data, converts it to 16-bit, and adds zero padding for non-multiple-of-eight prompt lengths. This kernel initializes its output registers to zero and includes conditional checks to ensure data is only loaded from valid locations, thereby preventing out-of-bounds memory access. The inclusion of zero padding ensures that the output buffer maintains a consistent structure, even when the input dimensions do not align perfectly with the expected tile size.
# Functions

---
### kernel\_transpose\_16
The `kernel_transpose_16` function performs a 16-bit transpose operation on a 4x4 tile of elements from an input image buffer and writes the transposed data to an output image buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `input`: A read-only 1D image buffer containing the input data to be transposed.
    - `output`: A write-only 1D image buffer where the transposed data will be stored.
    - `rows`: The number of rows in the input image buffer.
    - `cols`: The number of columns in the input image buffer.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the global IDs `i` and `j` for the current work item.
    - Calculate `i_2` and `j_2` by left-shifting `i` and `j` by 2, respectively, to determine the starting indices for the 4x4 tile.
    - Read four `half4` vectors from the input buffer at positions `(j_2+0)*cols+i`, `(j_2+1)*cols+i`, `(j_2+2)*cols+i`, and `(j_2+3)*cols+i`.
    - Write the transposed `half4` vectors to the output buffer at positions `(i_2+0)*rows+j`, `(i_2+1)*rows+j`, `(i_2+2)*rows+j`, and `(i_2+3)*rows+j`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it writes the transposed data directly to the output image buffer.

### kernel\_transpose\_32
The `kernel_transpose_32` function performs a 32-bit transpose operation on a 4x4 tile of elements from an input image buffer and writes the transposed data to an output image buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `input`: A read-only 1D image buffer containing the input data to be transposed.
    - `output`: A write-only 1D image buffer where the transposed data will be stored.
    - `rows`: The number of rows in the input image buffer.
    - `cols`: The number of columns in the input image buffer.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the global IDs for the current work item, `i` and `j`, which represent the row and column indices respectively.
    - Calculate `i_2` and `j_2` by left-shifting `i` and `j` by 2, effectively multiplying them by 4 to handle 4x4 tiles.
    - Read four float4 vectors from the input buffer at positions calculated using `j_2` and `i`, representing a 4x4 tile of elements.
    - Write the transposed elements to the output buffer using the calculated positions and the components of the read float4 vectors.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it writes the transposed 4x4 tile of float4 elements to the specified positions in the output image buffer.

### kernel\_transpose\_32\_16
The `kernel_transpose_32_16` function performs a 32-bit to 16-bit transpose of a 4x4 tile of elements from an input image buffer to an output image buffer, with zero padding for non-multiple of 8 prompt lengths.
- **Inputs**:
    - `input`: A read-only 1D image buffer containing the input data to be transposed.
    - `output`: A write-only 1D image buffer where the transposed data will be stored.
    - `rows`: The number of rows in the input data.
    - `cols`: The number of columns in the input data.
    - `padded_rows`: The number of rows in the output data, including any necessary padding.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the global IDs `i` and `j` for the current work item.
    - Calculate `i_2` and `j_2` as `i` and `j` shifted left by 2, respectively, to determine the starting indices for the 4x4 tile.
    - Initialize four `half4` variables (`temp0`, `temp1`, `temp2`, `temp3`) to zero to store the transposed elements.
    - For each row in the 4x4 tile, check if the index is within the valid range of the input buffer; if valid, read a `half4` from the input buffer into the corresponding `temp` variable.
    - Write the transposed `half4` data to the output buffer, using `padded_rows` to account for any necessary zero padding.
- **Output**: The function writes the transposed 16-bit data to the output image buffer, with zero padding applied as needed.
