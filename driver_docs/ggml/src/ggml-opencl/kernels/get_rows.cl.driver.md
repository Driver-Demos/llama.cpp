# Purpose
This source code file is designed for use with OpenCL, a framework for writing programs that execute across heterogeneous platforms. The file primarily focuses on operations related to data dequantization and retrieval of data rows from a source buffer. It includes type definitions for various integer types and a structure definition for `block_q4_0`, which is used to store quantized data. The file enables the use of the `cl_khr_fp16` extension, which allows for half-precision floating-point operations, indicating that the code is optimized for performance on platforms that support this extension.

The file contains several key functions and kernels. The `dequantize_q4_0_f32` function is responsible for converting quantized data stored in a `block_q4_0` structure into a floating-point format. This function uses bitwise operations to extract and scale the quantized values, storing the results in a `float16` register. The kernels `kernel_get_rows_f32`, `kernel_get_rows_f16`, and `kernel_get_rows_q4_0` are designed to retrieve rows of data from a source buffer and store them in a destination buffer. These kernels handle data in different formats: 32-bit floats, 16-bit floats, and quantized data, respectively. The `kernel_get_rows_q4_0` kernel specifically uses the `dequantize_q4_0_f32` function to handle quantized data, demonstrating the integration of dequantization within the data retrieval process.

Overall, this file provides specialized functionality for handling and processing quantized data in an OpenCL environment. It defines a set of operations that facilitate the conversion and manipulation of data in various formats, making it a crucial component for applications that require efficient data processing on heterogeneous computing platforms.
# Global Variables

### QK4\_0
- **Type**: `macro`
- **Description**: QK4_0 is a macro defined with a value of 32. It is used to specify the size of an array within the block_q4_0 struct, specifically for the qs array, which is of type uint8_t and has a size of QK4_0 / 2.
- **Use**: This macro is used to define the size of the qs array in the block_q4_0 struct, which is crucial for memory allocation and data processing within the dequantization functions.


# Data Structures

### block\_q4\_0
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `d`: A half-precision floating-point number used for scaling.
    - `qs`: An array of 16 unsigned 8-bit integers used for quantized storage.
- **Description**: The `block_q4_0` structure is designed to store quantized data in a compact form, using a half-precision floating-point number `d` for scaling and an array `qs` of 16 unsigned 8-bit integers to hold the quantized values. This structure is used in conjunction with dequantization functions to convert the stored quantized values back into floating-point numbers for further processing.

- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the quantized data as a pointer to a global ushort array starting from the second element of the `block_q4_0` structure.
