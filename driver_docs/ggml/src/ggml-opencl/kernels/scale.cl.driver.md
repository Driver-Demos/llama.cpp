# Purpose
This code is an OpenCL kernel, which is a function designed to be executed on a GPU or other parallel processing device. It provides narrow functionality, specifically for scaling a vector of `float4` elements by a given scalar value. The kernel function, `kernel_scale`, takes pointers to global memory locations for the source and destination vectors, along with offsets and a scaling factor. It adjusts the pointers by the specified offsets and then scales each element of the source vector by the given factor, storing the result in the destination vector. The use of `#pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_khr_fp16 : enable` suggests that the code may also support half-precision floating-point operations, although this specific kernel operates on `float4` data types.
# Functions

---
### kernel\_scale
The `kernel_scale` function scales each element of a global float4 array by a given factor and stores the result in another global float4 array.
- **Inputs**:
    - `src0`: A pointer to the global float4 array that serves as the source data to be scaled.
    - `offset0`: An unsigned long integer representing the byte offset to be applied to the source array pointer.
    - `dst`: A pointer to the global float4 array where the scaled results will be stored.
    - `offsetd`: An unsigned long integer representing the byte offset to be applied to the destination array pointer.
    - `scale`: A float value by which each element of the source array will be multiplied.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Adjust the source pointer `src0` by adding the byte offset `offset0`.
    - Adjust the destination pointer `dst` by adding the byte offset `offsetd`.
    - For each element in the global work-item space, multiply the corresponding element in the source array by the `scale` factor and store the result in the destination array.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the destination array in place.
