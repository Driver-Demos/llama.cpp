# Purpose
This source code file is an OpenCL kernel implementation that provides functionality for computing the SiLU (Sigmoid Linear Unit) activation function, which is commonly used in neural networks. The file contains two kernel functions: `kernel_silu` and `kernel_silu_4`. Both functions are designed to operate on arrays of data, applying the SiLU function to each element. The first kernel, `kernel_silu`, processes single precision floating-point numbers (`float`), while the second kernel, `kernel_silu_4`, is optimized for processing vectors of four single precision floating-point numbers (`float4`), which can enhance performance on hardware that supports vectorized operations.

The technical components of the code include the use of OpenCL's global memory space to handle input and output data, as well as the use of offsets to allow for flexible data access patterns. The kernels utilize the `get_global_id(0)` function to determine the index of the data element to process, enabling parallel execution across multiple data points. The SiLU function itself is computed using the formula `x / (1.0f + exp(-x))`, where `x` is the input value. This operation is performed element-wise on the input data, and the results are stored in the output array.

This file is intended to be used as part of a larger OpenCL program, where it can be compiled and executed on compatible hardware to perform the SiLU activation function in parallel. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly but provides the core computational logic that can be invoked by other parts of an OpenCL application. The use of the `#pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_khr_fp16 : enable` directive suggests that the code may also be compatible with half-precision floating-point operations, although this is not explicitly utilized in the provided kernels.
# Functions

---
### kernel\_silu
The `kernel_silu` function applies the Sigmoid Linear Unit (SiLU) activation function to each element of a global float array, with support for offset adjustments.
- **Inputs**:
    - `src0`: A global pointer to the source float array containing input values for the SiLU activation.
    - `offset0`: An unsigned long integer representing the byte offset to be applied to the source array pointer.
    - `dst`: A global pointer to the destination float array where the results of the SiLU activation will be stored.
    - `offsetd`: An unsigned long integer representing the byte offset to be applied to the destination array pointer.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Adjust the `src0` pointer by adding `offset0` to it, effectively moving the pointer to the correct starting position in the source array.
    - Adjust the `dst` pointer by adding `offsetd` to it, effectively moving the pointer to the correct starting position in the destination array.
    - Retrieve the current element from the adjusted `src0` array using the global ID as the index.
    - Compute the SiLU activation function for the retrieved element, which is `x / (1.0f + exp(-x))`.
    - Store the result of the SiLU computation in the corresponding position in the adjusted `dst` array.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it writes the results of the SiLU activation to the `dst` array in global memory.

### kernel\_silu\_4
The `kernel_silu_4` function applies the SiLU (Sigmoid Linear Unit) activation function to each element of a `float4` vector in a global array.
- **Inputs**:
    - `src0`: A global pointer to the input array of type `float4`.
    - `offset0`: An unsigned long integer representing the byte offset to be applied to the `src0` pointer.
    - `dst`: A global pointer to the output array of type `float4` where the results will be stored.
    - `offsetd`: An unsigned long integer representing the byte offset to be applied to the `dst` pointer.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Adjust the `src0` pointer by adding `offset0` bytes to it.
    - Adjust the `dst` pointer by adding `offsetd` bytes to it.
    - Retrieve the `float4` vector at the current global ID from the adjusted `src0` pointer.
    - Apply the SiLU function to each component of the `float4` vector: divide each component by (1.0 + exp(-component)).
    - Store the resulting `float4` vector at the current global ID in the adjusted `dst` pointer.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it writes the result of the SiLU activation to the `dst` array at the specified offset.
