# Purpose
This source code file is an OpenCL kernel implementation designed for performing matrix-vector multiplication with specific optimizations for certain GPU architectures, such as those using the Adreno GPU. The code leverages OpenCL extensions like `cl_khr_fp16` and `cl_khr_subgroups` to enable half-precision floating-point operations and subgroup operations, which are crucial for optimizing performance on supported hardware. The kernel, `kernel_gemv_noshuffle`, is responsible for computing the product of a quantized matrix and a vector, storing the result in a destination buffer. The kernel is structured to handle data in blocks, using subgroup operations to efficiently broadcast and accumulate results across multiple processing elements.

The file defines several macros for dequantizing and accumulating data blocks, which are used within the kernel to process quantized data efficiently. These macros, such as `dequantizeBlockAccum_ns_sgbroadcast_1_hi` and `dequantizeBlockAccum_ns_sgbroadcast_8_hi`, perform bit manipulation and scaling operations to convert quantized values back to floating-point representations, which are then used in the matrix-vector multiplication. The use of subgroup broadcasting allows the kernel to share data among work-items within a subgroup, reducing the need for global memory access and improving performance.

Overall, this code provides a specialized implementation of a matrix-vector multiplication operation, optimized for execution on GPUs with support for OpenCL extensions. It is designed to handle quantized data, making it suitable for applications where memory bandwidth and storage are constrained, such as in mobile or embedded systems. The kernel's design emphasizes efficient data handling and computation through the use of subgroup operations and half-precision arithmetic, which are key to achieving high performance on compatible hardware.
# Global Variables

### QK4\_0
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: QK4_0 is a global constant defined with a value of 32. It is used in the context of OpenCL kernel programming, specifically within the kernel_gemv_noshuffle function.
- **Use**: QK4_0 is used to determine the block size for looping over the K dimension in the kernel_gemv_noshuffle function.

### N\_SIMDGROUP
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: N_SIMDGROUP is a global constant defined with a value of 4. It represents the number of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) groups used in the kernel operations. This constant is used to control the granularity of parallel execution in the OpenCL kernel.
- **Use**: N_SIMDGROUP is used to determine the stride for block processing in the kernel, affecting how data is partitioned and processed in parallel.
