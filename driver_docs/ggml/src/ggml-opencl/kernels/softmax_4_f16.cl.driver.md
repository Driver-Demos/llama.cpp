# Purpose
This source code file is an OpenCL kernel implementation designed to perform a softmax operation on a set of input data. The kernel, named `kernel_soft_max_4_f16`, is optimized for execution on GPUs, with specific optimizations for Intel and Qualcomm Adreno GPUs. The code begins by enabling certain OpenCL extensions that are necessary for the kernel's execution, such as `cl_khr_fp16` for half-precision floating-point operations and subgroup extensions for efficient parallel processing. The kernel function takes several parameters, including pointers to input and output data, offsets, dimensions, scaling factors, and other parameters that influence the computation.

The kernel's primary function is to compute the softmax of a set of input values, which is a common operation in machine learning and neural networks. It does this by first calculating the maximum value in a parallel manner using subgroup operations, which helps in normalizing the input data. It then computes the exponentials of the scaled input values, sums them up, and finally normalizes these values to produce the softmax output. The kernel is designed to handle data in chunks of four (`float4` and `half4`), which aligns with the vectorized nature of GPU processing, thereby enhancing performance.

The code is structured to support different GPU architectures by conditionally defining macros and attributes based on the available extensions. This allows the kernel to leverage specific hardware features, such as required subgroup sizes, to optimize execution. The use of conditional compilation and OpenCL extensions indicates that this file is intended to be part of a larger system where it can be compiled and executed on different hardware platforms, providing a flexible and efficient solution for performing softmax operations in parallel computing environments.
# Functions

### kernel\_soft\_max\_4\_f16
The `kernel_soft_max_4_f16` function computes the softmax of a 4D tensor using OpenCL, with support for subgroup operations and optional masking.
- **Inputs**:
    - `src0`: A global pointer to the input tensor of type float.
    - `offset0`: An offset in bytes to be applied to the src0 pointer.
    - `src1`: A global pointer to the mask tensor of type half, used for optional masking.
    - `offset1`: An offset in bytes to be applied to the src1 pointer.
    - `dst`: A global pointer to the output tensor of type float.
    - `offsetd`: An offset in bytes to be applied to the dst pointer.
    - `ne00`: The size of the first dimension of the input tensor.
    - `ne01`: The size of the second dimension of the input tensor.
    - `ne02`: The size of the third dimension of the input tensor.
    - `scale`: A scaling factor applied to the input tensor.
    - `max_bias`: A bias value used in the ALiBi (Attention Linear Bias) calculation.
    - `m0`: A base value used in the ALiBi calculation for certain conditions.
    - `m1`: Another base value used in the ALiBi calculation for other conditions.
    - `n_head_log2`: A threshold value used to determine which base value to use in the ALiBi calculation.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Adjusts the input, mask, and output pointers by their respective offsets.
    - Determines the group and local IDs for parallel processing.
    - Calculates a slope for ALiBi if max_bias is greater than zero, using different base and exponent values based on the head index.
    - Performs a parallel maximum reduction across the input tensor, applying scaling and optional masking.
    - Reduces the local maximum values to a subgroup maximum.
    - Performs a parallel sum of exponentiated and scaled input values, storing intermediate results in the output tensor.
    - Reduces the local sums to a subgroup sum.
    - Normalizes the output tensor by dividing each element by the total sum.
- **Output**: The function writes the computed softmax values to the `dst` pointer, which is a global float pointer.
