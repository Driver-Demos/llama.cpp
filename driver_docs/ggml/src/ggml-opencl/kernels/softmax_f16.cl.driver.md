# Purpose
This source code file is an OpenCL kernel implementation designed to perform a softmax operation on floating-point data, specifically utilizing half-precision (fp16) and full-precision (fp32) floating-point numbers. The code is structured to leverage specific hardware capabilities, such as Intel and Qualcomm GPU extensions, to optimize performance. It conditionally enables OpenCL extensions based on the available hardware, allowing the kernel to utilize subgroup operations for efficient parallel computation. The kernel function `kernel_soft_max_f16` is the primary component, which processes input data arrays, applies scaling and bias adjustments, and computes the softmax function in a parallelized manner.

The kernel function takes several parameters, including pointers to input and output data arrays, offsets for these arrays, dimensions of the data, and additional parameters for scaling and biasing. It uses OpenCL's work-group and subgroup functionalities to distribute the computation across multiple processing elements, ensuring efficient utilization of the GPU's parallel processing capabilities. The code includes logic for handling different subgroup sizes based on the detected GPU type, either Intel or Qualcomm, which is crucial for optimizing the performance of the softmax operation on different hardware architectures.

Overall, this file provides a specialized implementation of the softmax function tailored for execution on GPUs with support for OpenCL extensions. It is designed to be integrated into larger applications that require efficient computation of the softmax function, such as neural network inference tasks. The use of conditional compilation and hardware-specific optimizations highlights the file's focus on maximizing performance across different GPU platforms.

### kernel\_soft\_max\_f16
The `kernel_soft_max_f16` function computes the softmax of a given input tensor with optional masking and scaling, optimized for execution on GPUs with subgroup extensions.
- **Inputs**:
    - `src0`: A global pointer to the input tensor of type float.
    - `offset0`: An offset in bytes to be applied to the src0 pointer.
    - `src1`: A global pointer to the mask tensor of type half, used for optional masking.
    - `offset1`: An offset in bytes to be applied to the src1 pointer.
    - `dst`: A global pointer to the output tensor of type float.
    - `offsetd`: An offset in bytes to be applied to the dst pointer.
    - `ne00`: The size of the first dimension of the input tensor.
    - `ne01`: The size of the second dimension of the input tensor.
    - `ne02`: The size of the third dimension of the input tensor.
    - `scale`: A scaling factor applied to the input tensor.
    - `max_bias`: A bias value used in the ALiBi (Attention Linear Bias) calculation.
    - `m0`: A base value used in the ALiBi calculation for certain conditions.
    - `m1`: Another base value used in the ALiBi calculation for other conditions.
    - `n_head_log2`: A threshold value used to determine which base value to use in the ALiBi calculation.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Adjusts the input and output pointers by their respective offsets.
    - Determines the group and local IDs for parallel processing.
    - Calculates a slope for ALiBi if max_bias is greater than zero, using different base values and exponents based on the head index.
    - Performs a parallel reduction to find the maximum value of the scaled and optionally masked input tensor.
    - Performs a parallel reduction to compute the sum of exponentials of the adjusted input values, storing intermediate results in the output tensor.
    - Normalizes the output tensor by dividing each element by the computed sum.
- **Output**: The function writes the computed softmax values to the output tensor pointed to by `dst`.
