# Purpose
This source code file is an OpenCL kernel implementation designed to perform matrix-vector multiplication using quantized data formats. The code is tailored to optimize performance on different GPU architectures, specifically Intel and Adreno GPUs, by enabling specific OpenCL extensions and defining architecture-specific subgroup sizes. The file includes preprocessor directives to conditionally compile code based on the available GPU features, such as subgroup sizes and required extensions, ensuring compatibility and performance optimization across different hardware.

The core functionality of the code revolves around the `block_q4_0` structure, which represents a quantized block of data, and the `block_q_4_0_dot_y_v` function, which computes the dot product between a quantized block and a vector. This function is optimized for performance by unrolling loops and using vector types, which is particularly beneficial for Adreno GPUs. The `mul_vec_q_n_f32_v` function orchestrates the matrix-vector multiplication by iterating over blocks of data and accumulating results using SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations, which are crucial for leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of modern GPUs.

The file defines a kernel function, `kernel_mul_mat_q4_0_f32_v`, which serves as the entry point for executing the matrix-vector multiplication on the GPU. This kernel function adjusts the input and output pointers based on provided offsets and invokes the `mul_vec_q_n_f32_v` function to perform the computation. The code is structured to handle different data layouts and dimensions, making it versatile for various matrix sizes and configurations. Overall, this file provides a specialized and efficient implementation for performing quantized matrix-vector multiplication on GPUs, with a focus on maximizing performance through hardware-specific optimizations.
