# Purpose
This source code file is an OpenCL kernel implementation designed to perform a root mean square (RMS) normalization operation on a dataset. The code is structured to leverage specific hardware capabilities by enabling various OpenCL extensions, such as `cl_khr_fp16` for half-precision floating-point operations and subgroup-related extensions for Intel and Qualcomm GPUs. The kernel is optimized to utilize the subgroup size feature, which allows for efficient parallel computation by dividing work into smaller, more manageable groups that can be processed concurrently.

The primary technical component of this file is the `kernel_rms_norm` function, which is responsible for executing the RMS normalization. This function takes several parameters, including pointers to the source and destination data, offsets, dimensions of the data, and a small epsilon value to prevent division by zero. The kernel calculates the sum of squares of the input data, reduces it across subgroups, and then normalizes the data by dividing by the square root of the mean plus epsilon. The use of subgroups and local memory barriers ensures that the computation is both efficient and synchronized across different work items.

Overall, this code provides a specialized functionality focused on RMS normalization, optimized for execution on specific GPU architectures. It is not a standalone executable but rather a kernel intended to be invoked within a larger OpenCL program. The file does not define public APIs or external interfaces but instead focuses on the internal implementation details necessary for high-performance computation on compatible hardware.
# Functions

---
### kernel\_rms\_norm
The `kernel_rms_norm` function performs a root mean square normalization on a 4D tensor using OpenCL, leveraging subgroup operations for parallel computation.
- **Inputs**:
    - `src0`: A global pointer to the source data, which is a 4D tensor.
    - `offset0`: An offset in bytes to adjust the starting point of the source data.
    - `dst`: A global pointer to the destination data where the normalized result will be stored.
    - `offsetd`: An offset in bytes to adjust the starting point of the destination data.
    - `ne00`: The size of the first dimension of the tensor.
    - `ne01`: The size of the second dimension of the tensor.
    - `ne02`: The size of the third dimension of the tensor.
    - `ne03`: The size of the fourth dimension of the tensor.
    - `nb01`: The byte stride between elements in the first dimension.
    - `nb02`: The byte stride between elements in the second dimension.
    - `nb03`: The byte stride between elements in the third dimension.
    - `eps`: A small epsilon value added to the mean to prevent division by zero.
    - `sum`: A local memory buffer used to store intermediate sum results, with size dependent on the number of subgroups.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Adjust the source and destination pointers by their respective offsets.
    - Calculate the group and local IDs for parallel processing.
    - Initialize a float4 vector `sumf` and a float `all_sum` to accumulate squared values.
    - Perform a parallel sum of squares of the input data using subgroup operations.
    - Store the reduced sum in the local memory buffer `sum` for each subgroup.
    - Use a barrier to synchronize threads and perform a reduction on the `sum` buffer to compute the mean.
    - Calculate the scale factor as the inverse square root of the mean plus epsilon.
    - Normalize the input data by multiplying with the scale factor and store the result in the destination buffer.
- **Output**: The function outputs the normalized tensor in the `dst` buffer, with each element scaled by the computed normalization factor.
