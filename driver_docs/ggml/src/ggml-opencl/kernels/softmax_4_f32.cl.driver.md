# Purpose
This source code file is an OpenCL kernel implementation designed to perform a softmax operation on a set of input data. The kernel, named `kernel_soft_max_4`, is optimized for execution on GPUs, with specific optimizations for Intel and Qualcomm Adreno GPUs. The code begins by enabling certain OpenCL extensions that are necessary for the kernel's execution, such as `cl_khr_fp16` for half-precision floating-point operations and subgroup extensions for efficient parallel processing. The kernel uses conditional compilation to define attributes and macros based on the available GPU architecture, ensuring that the code can leverage specific hardware capabilities for performance improvements.

The primary function of the kernel is to compute the softmax of a given input tensor, which is a common operation in machine learning and neural networks. The kernel takes several parameters, including pointers to input and output buffers, offsets, dimensions, scaling factors, and other parameters that influence the computation. The kernel uses OpenCL's parallel processing capabilities to efficiently compute the maximum value and the sum of exponentials across the input data, which are essential steps in the softmax calculation. The use of subgroup operations, such as `sub_group_reduce_max` and `sub_group_reduce_add`, allows for efficient reduction operations within the GPU's execution units.

Overall, this file provides a specialized and optimized implementation of the softmax function for use in GPU-accelerated environments. It is designed to be integrated into larger applications that require high-performance computation, such as deep learning frameworks or other scientific computing applications. The code is structured to take advantage of specific hardware features, making it a critical component for applications that demand efficient parallel processing and high throughput.
# Functions

---
### kernel\_soft\_max\_4
The `kernel_soft_max_4` function computes a softmax operation on input data using OpenCL, with optional masking and scaling, and writes the result to a destination buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `src0`: A global pointer to the source buffer containing input data.
    - `offset0`: An offset in bytes to be applied to the src0 buffer.
    - `src1`: A global pointer to the mask buffer, which may be the same as src0.
    - `offset1`: An offset in bytes to be applied to the src1 buffer.
    - `dst`: A global pointer to the destination buffer where the result will be stored.
    - `offsetd`: An offset in bytes to be applied to the dst buffer.
    - `ne00`: The size of the first dimension of the input data.
    - `ne01`: The size of the second dimension of the input data.
    - `ne02`: The size of the third dimension of the input data.
    - `scale`: A scaling factor applied to the input data.
    - `max_bias`: A bias value used to adjust the slope in the ALiBi mechanism.
    - `m0`: A base value used in the ALiBi slope calculation for certain conditions.
    - `m1`: A base value used in the ALiBi slope calculation for other conditions.
    - `n_head_log2`: A threshold value used to determine which base value to use in the ALiBi slope calculation.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Adjusts the pointers src0, src1, and dst by their respective offsets.
    - Retrieves the group IDs for the third, second, and first dimensions.
    - Calculates the slope for the ALiBi mechanism based on max_bias, m0, m1, and n_head_log2.
    - Initializes lmax4 to negative infinity and iterates over the input data to compute the maximum value after scaling and optional masking.
    - Uses sub_group_reduce_max to find the maximum value across the subgroup.
    - Initializes lsum4 to zero and iterates over the input data to compute the sum of exponentials of the scaled and masked values, storing intermediate results in pdst4.
    - Uses sub_group_reduce_add to find the sum of exponentials across the subgroup.
    - Normalizes the results in pdst4 by dividing each by the total sum.
- **Output**: The function writes the computed softmax values to the destination buffer `dst`.
