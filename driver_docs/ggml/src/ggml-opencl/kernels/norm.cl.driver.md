# Purpose
This source code file is an OpenCL kernel implementation designed to perform normalization on a dataset. The kernel, named `kernel_norm`, is responsible for computing the mean and variance of a given input data array, recentering the data by subtracting the mean, and then scaling it by the inverse of the standard deviation (computed from the variance and a small epsilon value for numerical stability). The kernel operates on a global input buffer `src0` and writes the normalized output to a global output buffer `dst`. The code is structured to handle multi-dimensional data, with parameters specifying the dimensions and offsets for accessing the data in memory.

The file includes preprocessor directives to enable specific OpenCL extensions, such as `cl_khr_fp16` for half-precision floating-point operations, and conditionally enables extensions for subgroup size control based on the target GPU architecture (Intel or Qualcomm Adreno). This allows the kernel to optimize its execution by specifying subgroup sizes that are suitable for the underlying hardware, potentially improving performance through better utilization of the GPU's parallel processing capabilities.

Overall, this code provides a focused functionality for data normalization, a common preprocessing step in machine learning and data analysis workflows. It leverages OpenCL's parallel computing capabilities to efficiently compute the necessary statistics and apply the normalization transformation across potentially large datasets. The use of local memory and barriers ensures that intermediate computations are synchronized and efficiently reduced across work-items within a work-group.
# Functions

---
### kernel\_norm
The `kernel_norm` function computes the mean and variance of a given input array, normalizes the data, and stores the result in an output array using OpenCL for parallel processing.
- **Inputs**:
    - `src0`: A global pointer to the input data array.
    - `offset0`: An offset in bytes to the starting point of the input data array.
    - `dst`: A global pointer to the output data array where the normalized data will be stored.
    - `offsetd`: An offset in bytes to the starting point of the output data array.
    - `ne00`: The size of the first dimension of the input data array.
    - `ne01`: The size of the second dimension of the input data array.
    - `ne02`: The size of the third dimension of the input data array.
    - `ne03`: The size of the fourth dimension of the input data array.
    - `nb01`: The byte stride between elements in the first dimension of the input data array.
    - `nb02`: The byte stride between elements in the second dimension of the input data array.
    - `nb03`: The byte stride between elements in the third dimension of the input data array.
    - `eps`: A small constant added to the variance to prevent division by zero during normalization.
    - `sum`: A local memory array used to store intermediate sums for parallel reduction.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Adjust the input and output pointers by their respective offsets.
    - Calculate the group and local IDs for parallel processing.
    - Initialize the local sum array to zero for each work item.
    - Perform a parallel sum to compute the mean of the input data.
    - Use a barrier to synchronize work items and perform a reduction to finalize the mean calculation.
    - Recenter the data by subtracting the mean and compute the variance in parallel.
    - Use a barrier to synchronize work items and perform a reduction to finalize the variance calculation.
    - Compute the scaling factor using the variance and epsilon.
    - Normalize the data by applying the scaling factor to the recentered data.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but writes the normalized data to the output array `dst`.
