# Purpose
This code is an OpenCL kernel, which provides a specific and narrow functionality for clamping values within a specified range. The kernel function `kernel_clamp` is designed to be executed on a GPU or other parallel processing device, where it processes arrays of floating-point numbers. It adjusts each element in the source array `src0` to ensure that it falls within the given `min` and `max` bounds, storing the result in the destination array `dst`. The use of `get_global_id(0)` indicates that this operation is performed in parallel across multiple data points, leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of OpenCL. The code also includes a directive to enable the `cl_khr_fp16` extension, which suggests that it may be optimized for devices supporting half-precision floating-point operations.
# Functions

---
### kernel\_clamp
The `kernel_clamp` function adjusts the values in a source array to ensure they fall within a specified minimum and maximum range, storing the results in a destination array.
- **Inputs**:
    - `src0`: A pointer to the global float array that serves as the source of values to be clamped.
    - `offset0`: An unsigned long integer representing the byte offset to be applied to the source array pointer.
    - `dst`: A pointer to the global float array where the clamped values will be stored.
    - `offsetd`: An unsigned long integer representing the byte offset to be applied to the destination array pointer.
    - `min`: A float value representing the minimum threshold for clamping.
    - `max`: A float value representing the maximum threshold for clamping.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Adjust the `src0` pointer by adding `offset0` bytes to it.
    - Adjust the `dst` pointer by adding `offsetd` bytes to it.
    - For each element in the source array, identified by `get_global_id(0)`, compare the value to `min` and `max`.
    - If the source value is less than `min`, set the destination value to `min`.
    - If the source value is greater than `max`, set the destination value to `max`.
    - Otherwise, set the destination value to the source value.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the destination array in place.
