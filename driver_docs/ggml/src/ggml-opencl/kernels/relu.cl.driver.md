# Purpose
This code is an OpenCL kernel function designed to perform the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) operation on a set of floating-point numbers. It provides narrow functionality, specifically tailored for applying the ReLU activation function, which is commonly used in neural networks to introduce non-linearity. The code is not an executable or a standalone application; rather, it is a kernel meant to be executed on a parallel computing device, such as a GPU, as part of a larger OpenCL program. The kernel takes input and output buffers, along with their respective offsets, and applies the ReLU function element-wise, setting each output element to the maximum of zero and the corresponding input element.
# Functions

---
### kernel\_relu
The `kernel_relu` function applies the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function to each element of a global input array and stores the result in a global output array.
- **Inputs**:
    - `src0`: A pointer to the global input array of floats, representing the source data to be processed.
    - `offset0`: An unsigned long integer representing the byte offset to be applied to the input array pointer.
    - `dst`: A pointer to the global output array of floats, where the processed data will be stored.
    - `offsetd`: An unsigned long integer representing the byte offset to be applied to the output array pointer.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Adjust the `src0` pointer by adding the `offset0` to it, effectively moving the pointer to the correct starting position in the input array.
    - Adjust the `dst` pointer by adding the `offsetd` to it, effectively moving the pointer to the correct starting position in the output array.
    - For each element in the input array, identified by the global ID, apply the ReLU function by taking the maximum of 0.0 and the input value, and store the result in the corresponding position in the output array.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the global output array `dst` in place by applying the ReLU function to each element of the input array `src0`.
