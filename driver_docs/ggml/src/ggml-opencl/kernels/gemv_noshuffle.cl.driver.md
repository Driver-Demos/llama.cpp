# Purpose
This source code file is an OpenCL kernel implementation designed for performing matrix-vector multiplication with specific optimizations for dequantization and accumulation. The kernel, named `kernel_gemv_noshuffle`, is tailored to handle quantized data, which is evident from the use of image buffers for reading quantized matrix data (`src0_q`) and scales (`src0_d`). The kernel is structured to efficiently process data in parallel using sub-group operations, which are enabled through OpenCL extensions like `cl_khr_subgroups` and potentially `cl_qcom_reqd_sub_group_size` for specific hardware optimizations on Adreno GPUs.

The file defines several macros for dequantization and accumulation operations, such as `dequantizeBlockAccum_ns_sgbroadcast_1_hi` and `dequantizeBlockAccum_ns_sgbroadcast_8_hi`, which are used within the kernel to process blocks of data. These macros utilize sub-group broadcasting to efficiently distribute data across work-items within a sub-group, allowing for parallel processing of quantized data blocks. The kernel reads quantized data and scales, performs dequantization, and accumulates the results into a floating-point output buffer (`dst`). The use of sub-group operations and local memory for reduction highlights the focus on optimizing performance for parallel execution on GPU architectures.

Overall, this code provides a specialized function for matrix-vector multiplication in a high-performance computing context, leveraging OpenCL's capabilities for parallel processing and hardware-specific optimizations. The kernel is designed to be integrated into larger applications that require efficient handling of quantized data, such as machine learning inference tasks where quantization is used to reduce model size and improve execution speed.
# Global Variables

### QK4\_0
- **Type**: ``int``
- **Description**: `QK4_0` is a global constant integer defined with a value of 32. It is used as a divisor in the loop within the `kernel_gemv_noshuffle` function to iterate over blocks of data.
- **Use**: `QK4_0` is used to determine the block size for processing in the loop of the `kernel_gemv_noshuffle` function.

### N\_SIMDGROUP
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: N_SIMDGROUP is a global constant defined with a value of 4. It represents the number of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) groups used in the kernel operations. This constant is used to control the iteration step size in the loop that processes data in blocks.
- **Use**: N_SIMDGROUP is used to determine the step size for iterating over data blocks in the kernel function, allowing the processing of data in parallel using SIMD groups.

### ADRENO\_GPU
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: The `ADRENO_GPU` variable is a preprocessor macro defined as 1 when the `cl_qcom_reqd_sub_group_size` extension is enabled. This macro is used to conditionally compile code specific to Adreno GPUs, which are a series of graphics processing units developed by Qualcomm.
- **Use**: `ADRENO_GPU` is used to enable specific code paths optimized for Adreno GPUs when the required extension is available.

### REQD\_SUBGROUP\_SIZE\_64
- **Type**: `__attribute__((qcom_reqd_sub_group_size("half")))`
- **Description**: The `REQD_SUBGROUP_SIZE_64` is a macro that defines a required sub-group size attribute for OpenCL kernels, specifically targeting Qualcomm Adreno GPUs. It is used to specify that the sub-group size should be set to 64 when the `cl_qcom_reqd_sub_group_size` extension is enabled.
- **Use**: This variable is used to enforce a specific sub-group size of 64 for OpenCL kernels on supported Qualcomm Adreno GPUs, optimizing performance by aligning with the hardware's capabilities.
