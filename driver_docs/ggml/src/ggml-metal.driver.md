## Files
- **[CMakeLists.txt](ggml-metal/CMakeLists.txt.driver.md)**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `llama.cpp/ggml/src/ggml-metal` directory configures the build process for the `ggml-metal` library, handling dependencies on Apple's Metal framework and setting up compilation and installation of Metal shader files.
- **[ggml-metal-impl.h](ggml-metal/ggml-metal-impl.h.driver.md)**: The `ggml-metal-impl.h` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase defines kernel parameters and argument structures for various operations in a Metal-based implementation, including matrix-vector operations, normalization, and convolution.
- **[ggml-metal.m](ggml-metal/ggml-metal.m.driver.md)**: The `ggml-metal.m` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase implements a Metal-based backend for a machine learning library, providing GPU-accelerated tensor operations on Apple devices through the Metal API, with functionalities including device and memory management, kernel definitions, and execution logic for various neural network computations, and it includes structures and functions for managing Metal devices, memory pools, command buffers, and kernel operations.
- **[ggml-metal.metal](ggml-metal/ggml-metal.m.driver.mdetal)**: The `ggml-metal.metal` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase contains a suite of Metal Shading Language (MSL) kernels designed for high-performance computing on Apple devices, focusing on machine learning and neural network computations, with functionalities including tensor operations, quantization, dequantization, matrix-vector multiplication, and various activation functions, all optimized for GPU execution.
