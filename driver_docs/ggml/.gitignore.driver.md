# Purpose
The file contents list two source files, `src/ggml-vulkan-shaders.hpp` and `src/ggml-vulkan-shaders.cpp`, which are likely part of a software project. These files are likely related to the implementation of Vulkan shaders within the GGML (General Graphical Machine Learning) framework, with the header file (`.hpp`) declaring interfaces and the source file (`.cpp`) providing the implementation details.
