# Purpose
The provided content is a formal grammar specification for JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), a lightweight data interchange format. This grammar defines the structure and syntax rules for valid JSON data, including objects, arrays, strings, numbers, and special literals like true, false, and null. The `object` rule describes how key-value pairs are enclosed in curly braces, while the `array` rule specifies how values are listed within square brackets. The `string` rule outlines the format for string values, including escape sequences, and the `number` rule details the representation of numeric values, including optional decimal and exponential parts. The `ws` rule defines optional whitespace, allowing for spaces and newlines to be used for formatting without affecting the data structure. This grammar is essential for parsing and validating JSON data in software applications.
