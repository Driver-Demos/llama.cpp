# Purpose
The provided content is a grammar definition for parsing JSON-like data structures, specifically tailored to handle JSON arrays with restricted whitespace at the end of the root array. This grammar is written in a format similar to Backus-Naur Form (BNF) and defines the syntax rules for various JSON components such as objects, arrays, strings, numbers, and boolean/null values. The `root` rule specifies that the top-level structure is an array (`arr`), and the `ws` rule defines optional whitespace, allowing for spaces and newlines with specific constraints. This configuration is particularly useful for applications that need to generate or validate JSON arrays while ensuring that unnecessary trailing whitespace is minimized, thereby maintaining a clean and consistent data format.
