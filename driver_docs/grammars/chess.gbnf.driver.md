# Purpose
The provided content is a grammar specification for parsing chess moves written in a format that resembles Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF). It defines the structure of chess moves using the Portable Game Notation (PGN) conventions, which are commonly used to record chess games. The `root` rule specifies that a game starts with the first move labeled as "1. ", followed by a sequence of moves, each consisting of a pair of moves for white and black, with move numbers incrementing sequentially. The `move` rule can be a pawn move, a non-pawn move, or a castling move, with optional annotations for check or checkmate. The `nonpawn` rule describes moves for pieces other than pawns, including optional file or rank disambiguation, captures, and destination squares. The `pawn` rule accounts for pawn moves, including optional captures and promotions. The `castle` rule defines the notation for castling moves, either kingside ("O-O") or queenside ("O-O-O").
