# Purpose
This file defines a grammar specification for parsing Japanese text, using a simplified and possibly incorrect set of rules. It outlines the structure of Japanese characters, categorizing them into hiragana, katakana, punctuation, and CJK (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) characters, and describes how these character types can be combined to form valid sequences.
