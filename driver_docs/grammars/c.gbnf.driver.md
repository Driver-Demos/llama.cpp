# Purpose
The provided content is a formal grammar specification for a simple programming language, likely used for educational purposes or as a part of a compiler or interpreter project. This grammar is defined using a variant of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), which describes the syntax rules for constructing valid statements and expressions in the language. It includes definitions for basic data types (`int`, `float`, `char`), identifiers, parameters, and various types of statements such as variable declarations, assignments, function calls, control flow constructs (`while`, `for`, `if-else`), and comments. The grammar also specifies how expressions are formed using operators and operands, including arithmetic operations and function calls. This specification serves as a blueprint for parsing and understanding the structure of programs written in this language.
