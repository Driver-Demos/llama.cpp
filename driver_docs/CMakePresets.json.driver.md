# Purpose
This file is a JSON configuration file used to define build presets for a CMake-based project. It provides a structured way to specify various build configurations, such as different compilers, build types (e.g., Debug, Release), and target architectures (e.g., x64, arm64). The file contains multiple "configurePresets," each with a unique name and a set of properties, including generator type, binary directory, and cache variables that influence the build process. Some presets inherit properties from others, allowing for modular and reusable configurations. This file is crucial for automating and managing complex build environments, ensuring consistency and efficiency in the software development lifecycle.
# Content Summary
This JSON configuration file defines a set of build presets for a software project, utilizing CMake as the build system. The file is structured to support various build configurations and environments, primarily focusing on different architectures, compilers, and build types. The key component of this file is the `configurePresets` array, which contains multiple preset objects, each specifying a unique build configuration.

Each preset is defined with a `name` and a set of properties. The `hidden` property, set to `true` for all presets, indicates that these presets are not intended to be listed by default when querying available presets. The `generator` property, specified as "Ninja" for some presets, indicates the build system generator to be used. The `binaryDir` property uses a template variable `${sourceDir}/build-${presetName}` to define the output directory for build artifacts, dynamically incorporating the preset name.

The `cacheVariables` property within each preset specifies key-value pairs for CMake cache variables, which influence the build process. Common variables include `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS`, which is set to "ON" to generate a compilation database, and `CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH`, which configures runtime library paths. Some presets specify compilers, such as `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` and `CMAKE_C_COMPILER`, to use specific tools like "icx" and "cl" for SYCL-based builds.

Several presets are designed for specific platforms and toolchains, such as `x64-windows-llvm`, `arm64-windows-llvm`, and `arm64-apple-clang`, each with a `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` pointing to a corresponding CMake toolchain file. These presets also define architecture and toolset strategies, indicating external handling of these configurations.

The file also includes composite presets that inherit properties from base presets. For example, `arm64-windows-llvm-debug` inherits from "base", "arm64-windows-llvm", and "debug", combining their configurations. This inheritance mechanism allows for flexible and reusable build configurations, enabling developers to easily switch between different build environments and settings.

Overall, this configuration file provides a comprehensive and modular approach to managing build settings for a complex software project, supporting multiple platforms, architectures, and build types.
