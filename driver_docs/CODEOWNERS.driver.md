# Purpose
This file is a code review assignment configuration, where collaborators can list themselves as available reviewers for specific directories or files within the codebase. Each line associates a file path or pattern with a GitHub username, indicating that the specified user is responsible for reviewing pull requests related to those files. This helps streamline the code review process by clearly designating reviewers for different parts of the project.
