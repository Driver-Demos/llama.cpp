# Purpose
The provided Python script is a utility designed for contributors working with Hugging Face models, specifically to download tokenizer models and update a function in the `convert_hf_to_gguf.py` script. The script is not intended for end users but rather for developers who need to analyze and implement pre-tokenizer configurations for various models. It facilitates the downloading of tokenizer models from Hugging Face, computes unique identifiers for these models, and updates the `get_vocab_base_pre()` function in the `convert_hf_to_gguf.py` script with these identifiers. This process ensures that the pre-tokenizer used by a model is correctly implemented in the `llama.cpp` project via the GGUF header.

The script includes several key components: it defines a list of models with their respective tokenizer types and repositories, handles authentication for downloading files, and manages the creation of directories for storing tokenizer files. It also includes functionality to compute SHA-256 hashes of tokenized text, which serve as unique identifiers for the pre-tokenizers. Additionally, the script generates test cases for each tokenizer model and provides commands for creating vocabulary files for testing purposes. The script is structured to handle both local file paths and remote URLs for model repositories, and it includes error handling to manage issues such as missing files or inaccessible models.
