## Folders
- **[scripts](gguf/scripts.driver.md)**: The `scripts` folder in the `llama.cpp` codebase contains Python scripts for manipulating GGUF format model files, including tasks such as converting byte order, dumping metadata, editing via a GUI, calculating hashes, and modifying metadata.

## Files
- **[__init__.py](gguf/__init__.py.driver.md)**: The `__init__.py` file in the `llama.cpp/gguf-py/gguf` directory initializes the `gguf` package by importing various modules such as constants, lazy, gguf_reader, gguf_writer, quants, tensor_mapping, vocab, utility, and metadata.
- **[constants.py](gguf/constants.py.driver.md)**: The `constants.py` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase defines various constants, metadata keys, and enumerations related to model architectures, tensor types, quantization types, and other configurations for the GGUF format.
- **[gguf.py](gguf/gguf.py.driver.md)**: The `gguf.py` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase serves as a compatibility layer for users attempting to import the GGUF API directly from `gguf/gguf.py` instead of as a package.
- **[gguf_reader.py](gguf/gguf_reader.py.driver.md)**: The `gguf_reader.py` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase provides functionality for reading and modifying GGUF files, including handling metadata fields and tensor data.
- **[gguf_writer.py](gguf/gguf_writer.py.driver.md)**: The `gguf_writer.py` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase provides a comprehensive implementation for writing GGUF (General Graph Universal Format) files, including functionalities for managing tensor information, key-value data, and various metadata attributes, as well as handling file operations and data alignment.
- **[lazy.py](gguf/lazy.py.driver.md)**: The `lazy.py` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase implements a framework for lazy evaluation of tensor operations, specifically for NumPy arrays, using a metaclass to handle special methods and a base class to manage lazy computation and conversion between eager and lazy states.
- **[metadata.py](gguf/metadata.py.driver.md)**: The `metadata.py` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase defines a `Metadata` class for handling authorship metadata related to models, including methods for loading, applying heuristics, and setting metadata in a GGUF key-value store.
- **[py.typed](gguf/py.typed.driver.md)**: Empty file (no analyzable contents).
- **[quants.py](gguf/quants.py.driver.md)**: The `quants.py` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase provides a comprehensive implementation of various quantization and dequantization methods for tensors, supporting multiple quantization types defined by the `GGMLQuantizationType` enumeration.
- **[tensor_mapping.py](gguf/tensor_mapping.py.driver.md)**: The `tensor_mapping.py` file defines a `TensorNameMap` class that maps model tensor names to their corresponding types and names based on model architecture and block configurations.
- **[utility.py](gguf/utility.py.driver.md)**: The `utility.py` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase provides functions for handling file naming conventions, model parameter size formatting, and managing remote safetensor files, including retrieving tensor metadata and data from Hugging Face model repositories.
- **[vocab.py](gguf/vocab.py.driver.md)**: The `vocab.py` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase provides classes and methods for handling different types of vocabularies, including special tokens and added tokens, for various tokenizer models such as BPE, SentencePiece, and Llama.
