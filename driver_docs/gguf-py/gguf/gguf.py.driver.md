# Purpose
This Python script serves as a compatibility layer for users attempting to import the `gguf` module directly from its file path rather than as a package. It modifies the system path to include the parent directory of the current file, ensuring that the `gguf` module can be imported correctly. The script uses `importlib` to invalidate caches and reload the `gguf` module, which helps in maintaining the module's state and ensuring that the latest version is used. This file provides narrow functionality, focusing solely on maintaining backward compatibility for users who might not follow the recommended import practices.
