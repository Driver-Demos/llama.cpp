# Purpose
This Python script is designed to compute and display cryptographic hashes for tensors within a GGUF (Generic Graph Universal Format) file, which is a specific format for storing model data. The script uses the `GGUFReader` class to read the model file and iterates over its tensors to calculate SHA-1, SHA-256, and UUIDv5 hashes. It excludes certain tensor types from the hashing process, specifically those ending with ".attention.masked_bias", ".attention.bias", and ".rotary_emb.inv_freq". The script provides options to exclude per-layer hashes and to enable a progress bar during the hashing process, which is useful for tracking the progress of the operation on large files.

The script is structured as a command-line utility, utilizing the `argparse` module to handle input arguments. It includes options for verbosity and progress bar display, making it flexible for different user needs. The main function initializes logging based on the verbosity level and sets up the GGUFReader to process the specified model file. The script is intended to be executed directly and is not designed as a library for importation into other Python modules. The use of UUIDs and cryptographic hashes suggests a focus on ensuring data integrity and uniqueness, which is critical in contexts where model data verification is necessary.
# Imports and Dependencies

# Global Variables

---
### logger
- **Type**: `logging.Logger`
- **Description**: The `logger` variable is an instance of a `Logger` object from the Python `logging` module, configured to handle logging for the application with the name 'gguf-hash'. This allows the application to output log messages, which can be useful for debugging and monitoring the application's behavior.
- **Use**: The `logger` is used to manage and output log messages throughout the application, providing a standardized way to report information, warnings, and errors.


---
### UUID\_NAMESPACE\_LLAMA\_CPP
- **Type**: `uuid.UUID`
- **Description**: `UUID_NAMESPACE_LLAMA_CPP` is a UUID object created using a specific UUID string 'ef001206-dadc-5f6d-a15f-3359e577d4e5'. This UUID is used as a namespace identifier for generating other UUIDs, particularly in the context of hashing operations within the script.
- **Use**: This variable is used to initialize a SHA-1 hash for UUID version 5 generation, which is part of the hashing process for GGUF file metadata.


# Functions

---
### gguf\_hash<!-- {{#callable:llama.cpp/gguf-py/gguf/scripts/gguf_hash.gguf_hash}} -->
The `gguf_hash` function computes SHA-1, SHA-256, and UUIDv5 hashes for tensors in a GGUF file, optionally displaying progress and per-layer hashes.
- **Inputs**:
    - `reader`: An instance of `GGUFReader` that provides access to the tensors to be hashed.
    - `filename`: A string representing the name of the file being processed.
    - `disable_progress_bar`: A boolean indicating whether to disable the progress bar during hashing.
    - `no_layer`: A boolean indicating whether to skip printing per-layer hash information.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize SHA-1, SHA-256, and UUIDv5 hash objects.
    - Calculate the total number of weights in the tensors for progress bar setup, skipping certain tensor types.
    - Initialize a progress bar using `tqdm` with the total weight count.
    - Iterate over each tensor in the reader.
    - Skip tensors with names ending in specific suffixes (e.g., '.attention.masked_bias').
    - Update the progress bar with the weight count of each tensor.
    - If `no_layer` is False, compute and print SHA-1 and SHA-256 hashes for each tensor layer.
    - Update the overall SHA-1, SHA-256, and UUIDv5 hashes with the tensor data.
    - Close the progress bar after processing all tensors.
    - Print the final SHA-1, SHA-256, and UUIDv5 hash values for the entire file.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it prints the computed hash values to the console.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:llama.cpp/gguf-py/gguf/scripts/gguf_hash.main}} -->
The `main` function parses command-line arguments to configure logging and initiate the GGUF file hashing process.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - An `ArgumentParser` is created to handle command-line arguments for the script.
    - The parser is configured to accept a mandatory 'model' argument and optional flags for 'no-layer', 'verbose', and 'progressbar'.
    - The parsed arguments are stored in the `args` variable, with a fallback to display help if no arguments are provided.
    - Logging is configured to DEBUG level if the 'verbose' flag is set, otherwise INFO level is used.
    - A `GGUFReader` object is instantiated with the model filename provided in the arguments.
    - The [`gguf_hash`](#cpp/gguf-py/gguf/scripts/gguf_hashgguf_hash) function is called with the reader, model filename, and flags for progress bar and layer exclusion.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs actions based on command-line input and outputs hash information to the console.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`llama.cpp/gguf-py/gguf/scripts/gguf_hash.gguf_hash`](#cpp/gguf-py/gguf/scripts/gguf_hashgguf_hash)
