# Purpose
This Python script is designed to modify metadata within a GGUF (Generic Graphical User Format) file. It provides a command-line interface for users to specify a GGUF file, a metadata key, and a new value to set for that key. The script uses the `GGUFReader` class from the `gguf` package to read and manipulate the file's metadata. The primary functionality is encapsulated in the [`set_metadata`](#cpp/gguf-py/gguf/scripts/gguf_set_metadataset_metadata) function, which retrieves the specified metadata field, checks its type, and updates its value if it is a simple scalar type. The script includes safety checks, such as a confirmation prompt unless the `--force` flag is used, to prevent accidental corruption of the GGUF file.

The script is structured to be executed as a standalone command-line tool, as indicated by the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block, which calls the [`main`](#cpp/gguf-py/gguf/scripts/gguf_set_metadatamain) function. The [`main`](#cpp/gguf-py/gguf/scripts/gguf_set_metadatamain) function sets up argument parsing using the `argparse` module, allowing users to specify options like `--dry-run` for testing changes without applying them and `--verbose` for increased logging output. The script also includes logging to provide feedback on its operations, such as loading the file, preparing to change a field, and confirming successful completion. This tool is particularly useful for users needing to update metadata in GGUF files while ensuring data integrity through its built-in checks and confirmations.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `logging`
- `argparse`
- `os`
- `sys`
- `pathlib.Path`
- `gguf.GGUFReader`


# Global Variables

---
### logger
- **Type**: `logging.Logger`
- **Description**: The `logger` variable is an instance of a `Logger` object from the Python `logging` module, configured to log messages for the 'gguf-set-metadata' application. It is used to record informational, warning, and error messages throughout the script, aiding in debugging and providing runtime feedback to the user.
- **Use**: This variable is used to log messages at various levels (info, warning, error) to provide feedback and error reporting during the execution of the script.


# Functions

---
### minimal\_example<!-- {{#callable:llama.cpp/gguf-py/gguf/scripts/gguf_set_metadata.minimal_example}} -->
The function `minimal_example` modifies a specific field in a GGUF file by setting its value to 2 if the field exists.
- **Inputs**:
    - `filename`: A string representing the path to the GGUF file to be modified.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Create a GGUFReader object to read and modify the file specified by the filename.
    - Access the 'tokenizer.ggml.bos_token_id' field from the reader's fields.
    - Check if the field is None, and if so, return immediately without making changes.
    - Retrieve the part index from the field's data attribute, which indicates the location of the field value.
    - Set the field value at the specified part index to 2, effectively modifying the 'tokenizer.ggml.bos_token_id' field.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs an in-place modification of the GGUF file.


---
### set\_metadata<!-- {{#callable:llama.cpp/gguf-py/gguf/scripts/gguf_set_metadata.set_metadata}} -->
The `set_metadata` function updates a specified metadata field in a GGUF file with a new value, with options for dry-run and confirmation prompts.
- **Inputs**:
    - `reader`: An instance of GGUFReader used to access and modify the GGUF file's metadata.
    - `args`: An argparse.Namespace object containing command-line arguments, including the key of the metadata field to update, the new value, and flags for dry-run and force options.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the metadata field using the key from args; if not found, log an error and exit.
    - Check if the field's type is supported for modification; if not, log an error and exit.
    - Retrieve the current value of the field and convert the new value using the appropriate handler.
    - Log the planned change from the current value to the new value.
    - If the current value is the same as the new value, log a message and exit.
    - If the dry-run flag is set, exit without making changes.
    - If the force flag is not set, prompt the user for confirmation; if not confirmed, log a message and exit.
    - Update the field with the new value and log a success message.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but modifies the metadata field in the GGUF file and logs messages to indicate the process and any errors.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:llama.cpp/gguf-py/gguf/scripts/gguf_set_metadata.main}} -->
The `main` function parses command-line arguments to set a metadata value in a GGUF file, optionally with verbosity and confirmation controls.
- **Inputs**:
    - `None`: The function does not take any direct input parameters; it uses command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - An argument parser is created with a description and several arguments: 'model', 'key', 'value', '--dry-run', '--force', and '--verbose'.
    - The command-line arguments are parsed, defaulting to showing help if no arguments are provided.
    - Logging is configured to DEBUG level if '--verbose' is set, otherwise to INFO level.
    - A log message is generated to indicate the loading of the specified model file.
    - A `GGUFReader` object is instantiated with the model file in read-only mode if '--dry-run' is set, otherwise in read-write mode.
    - The [`set_metadata`](#cpp/gguf-py/gguf/scripts/gguf_set_metadataset_metadata) function is called with the `GGUFReader` object and parsed arguments.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs operations based on command-line arguments and may exit the program with a status code.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`llama.cpp/gguf-py/gguf/scripts/gguf_set_metadata.set_metadata`](#cpp/gguf-py/gguf/scripts/gguf_set_metadataset_metadata)
