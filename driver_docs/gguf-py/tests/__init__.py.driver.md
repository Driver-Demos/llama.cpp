# Purpose
This code is a short script that imports all the contents from a module named `test_metadata` located in the same package. The use of the wildcard import (`*`) suggests that the script is designed to provide broad functionality by making all classes, functions, and variables from `test_metadata` available in the current module. This approach is often used in test suites or initialization scripts to consolidate and simplify access to various components defined in separate modules. However, it can also lead to namespace pollution, making it less clear which specific elements are being utilized unless the `test_metadata` module is examined directly.
