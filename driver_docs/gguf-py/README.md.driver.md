# Purpose
The provided content is a documentation file for the "gguf" Python package, which is designed to facilitate the creation and manipulation of binary files in the GGUF (GGML Universal File) format. This package offers a narrow functionality focused on handling GGUF files, which are used within the GGML framework. The documentation outlines installation instructions, API examples, and scripts for various operations such as reading, writing, and editing GGUF files, as well as converting their endianness. It also provides guidance for development, including editable installation for maintainers, and details on both automatic and manual publishing processes. The file is crucial for developers working with GGUF files, as it provides essential information on how to use the package effectively within a codebase.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a comprehensive guide for the `gguf` Python package, which is designed for writing binary files in the GGUF (GGML Universal File) format. This package is part of the GGML project and facilitates the creation, manipulation, and inspection of GGUF files. The documentation outlines several key aspects of the package, including installation, usage examples, development guidelines, and publishing instructions.

### Installation
The package can be installed via pip with a simple command: `pip install gguf`. An optional installation with GUI support is available using `pip install gguf[gui]`, which enables a visual editor for GGUF files.

### API Examples and Tools
The documentation provides links to example scripts and tools that demonstrate the package's functionality:
- `writer.py`: Generates an example GGUF file.
- `reader.py`: Reads and displays key-value pairs and tensor details from a GGUF file.
- `gguf_dump.py`: Outputs a GGUF file's metadata to the console.
- `gguf_set_metadata.py`: Modifies metadata values in a GGUF file.
- `gguf_convert_endian.py`: Changes the endianness of GGUF files.
- `gguf_new_metadata.py`: Copies a GGUF file with modified metadata.
- `gguf_editor_gui.py`: A Qt-based GUI for editing GGUF file metadata and viewing tensors.

### Development
For developers, the package can be installed in editable mode to facilitate ongoing development. This requires navigating to the package directory and using the `pip install --editable .` command. Developers may need to upgrade their Pip installation to support editable installations.

### Publishing
The package supports both automatic and manual publishing processes. Automatic publishing is integrated with GitHub workflows, triggered by creating tags in a specific format. Manual publishing requires the `twine` and `build` tools, and involves updating the version in `pyproject.toml`, building the package, and uploading the distribution archives.

### Testing
Unit tests can be executed from the root of the repository using the command `python -m unittest discover ./gguf-py -v`, ensuring the package's functionality is verified.

### Future Enhancements
A noted TODO item is the inclusion of conversion scripts as command line entry points, which would enhance the package's usability by allowing direct command line interactions.

This documentation provides a clear and structured overview of the `gguf` package, making it accessible for both users and developers to install, use, and contribute to the project.
