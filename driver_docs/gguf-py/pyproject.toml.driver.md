# Purpose
The provided content is a `pyproject.toml` file, which is a configuration file used by the Python packaging tool, Poetry. This file defines the metadata and dependencies for a Python project named "gguf," which is at version 0.17.0. The project is designed to read and write machine learning models in the GGUF format for GGML. It specifies the package's authors, description, and links to its homepage and repository. The file also lists the required dependencies for both runtime and development, including Python version constraints and optional dependencies for GUI support. Additionally, it defines entry points for command-line scripts that are part of the package, facilitating various operations related to GGUF model handling.
