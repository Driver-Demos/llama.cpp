# Purpose
This Python script demonstrates the usage of a custom library, `gguf`, specifically focusing on the `GGUFWriter` class. The script is structured as an executable script, as indicated by the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block, which calls the [`writer_example`](#cpp/gguf-py/examples/writerwriter_example) function. The primary purpose of this script is to showcase how to create and manipulate a GGUF file, which appears to be a custom file format, using the `GGUFWriter` class. The script includes operations such as adding block counts, writing integer and float values, setting custom alignments, and adding tensors to the file. It utilizes the `numpy` library to create and manage tensor data, which is then written to the GGUF file.

The script is not a broad library but rather a focused example of how to use the `GGUFWriter` class to perform specific file operations. It imports the `GGUFWriter` from a local package, indicating that the `gguf` package is a custom or third-party library not included in the standard Python library. The script does not define public APIs or external interfaces but serves as a practical example for users who need to understand how to use the `GGUFWriter` class to write data to a GGUF file. The inclusion of detailed operations such as adding tensors and writing headers suggests that the script is intended for users who need to perform complex data serialization tasks using the GGUF format.

### writer\_example<!-- {{#callable:llama.cpp/gguf-py/examples/writer.writer_example}} -->
The `writer_example` function demonstrates how to use the `GGUFWriter` class to write metadata and tensor data to a file.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Instantiate a `GGUFWriter` object with the filename 'example.gguf' and the identifier 'llama'.
    - Add a block count of 12 to the writer using `add_block_count`.
    - Add a 32-bit unsigned integer with the key 'answer' and value 42 using `add_uint32`.
    - Add a 32-bit float with the key 'answer_in_float' and value 42.0 using `add_float32`.
    - Set a custom alignment of 64 using `add_custom_alignment`.
    - Create three tensors (`tensor1`, `tensor2`, `tensor3`) with different sizes and fill them with specific float values using `numpy.ones`.
    - Add each tensor to the writer with corresponding keys using `add_tensor`.
    - Write the header, key-value data, and tensor data to the file using `write_header_to_file`, `write_kv_data_to_file`, and `write_tensors_to_file` respectively.
    - Close the writer to finalize the file using `close`.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs file operations to write data to 'example.gguf'.
