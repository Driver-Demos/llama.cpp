# Purpose
This Python script is designed to read and display information from a GGUF (Generic Graphical User Format) file. It serves as a utility tool that provides a detailed view of the contents of a GGUF file by extracting and printing key-value pairs and tensor information in a structured format. The script imports a custom module, `GGUFReader`, from the `gguf` package, which is responsible for parsing the GGUF file. The main functionality is encapsulated in the [`read_gguf_file`](#cpp/gguf-py/examples/readerread_gguf_file) function, which takes the path to a GGUF file as an argument and outputs the data in a human-readable format, including the keys, their corresponding values, and detailed tensor information such as name, shape, size, and quantization type.

The script is intended to be executed as a standalone command-line tool, as indicated by the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block. It requires the user to provide the path to a GGUF file as a command-line argument. If no argument is provided, it logs a usage message and exits. The script uses Python's logging module to handle informational messages, and it manipulates the system path to ensure the local `gguf` package is accessible. This script is a specialized utility with a narrow focus on reading and displaying GGUF file contents, making it useful for developers or users who need to inspect or debug GGUF files.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `logging`
- `sys`
- `pathlib.Path`
- `gguf.gguf_reader.GGUFReader`


# Global Variables

---
### logger
- **Type**: `logging.Logger`
- **Description**: The `logger` variable is an instance of a Logger object obtained from the logging module, specifically configured with the name 'reader'. This allows for logging messages that are associated with the 'reader' context, which can be useful for debugging or informational purposes.
- **Use**: The `logger` is used to log informational messages, such as usage instructions, when the script is executed without the required arguments.


# Functions

---
### read\_gguf\_file<!-- {{#callable:llama.cpp/gguf-py/examples/reader.read_gguf_file}} -->
The `read_gguf_file` function reads a GGUF file and prints its key-value pairs and tensor information in a formatted manner.
- **Inputs**:
    - `gguf_file_path`: Path to the GGUF file to be read.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a [`GGUFReader`](../gguf/gguf_reader.py.driver.md#cpp/gguf-py/gguf/gguf_readerGGUFReader) object with the provided file path.
    - Calculate the maximum key length from the keys in the reader's fields for formatting purposes.
    - Iterate over each key-value pair in the reader's fields and print them in a columnized format.
    - Print a separator line to distinguish between key-value pairs and tensor information.
    - Define a format string for displaying tensor information with headers for 'Tensor Name', 'Shape', 'Size', and 'Quantization'.
    - Print the header line for tensor information.
    - Iterate over each tensor in the reader's tensors, format its details, and print them according to the defined format.
- **Output**: The function outputs formatted text to the console, displaying key-value pairs and tensor information from the GGUF file.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`llama.cpp/gguf-py/gguf/gguf_reader.GGUFReader`](../gguf/gguf_reader.py.driver.md#cpp/gguf-py/gguf/gguf_readerGGUFReader)
