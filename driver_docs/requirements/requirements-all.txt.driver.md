# Purpose
This file is a requirements file, typically used in Python projects, that aggregates dependencies from multiple other requirements files. Each line prefixed with `-r` indicates a path to another requirements file, which contains specific dependencies needed for different tools, tests, or functionalities within the project. This structure allows for modular management of dependencies by referencing and consolidating them from various components of the codebase.
