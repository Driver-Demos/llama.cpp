# Purpose
This file is a configuration for a package manager, likely pip, specifying additional package index URLs to search for Python packages. It includes a reference to a requirements file, `requirements-convert_hf_to_gguf.txt`, and adds two extra index URLs for PyTorch packages, including a nightly build URL, to ensure access to specific or pre-release versions of packages.
