# Purpose
This file is a Python `requirements.txt` file that specifies the dependencies for a software project. Each line lists a package with a version constraint using the `~=` operator, indicating compatibility with the specified version, allowing for updates that do not change the leftmost non-zero digit. This ensures that the project uses compatible versions of these libraries when installed.
