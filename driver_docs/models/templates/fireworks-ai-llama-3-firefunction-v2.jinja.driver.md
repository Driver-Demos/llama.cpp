# Purpose
This file appears to be a Jinja2 template used for generating dynamic content, likely in a configuration or script generation context. It sets up variables and filters to process messages and roles, ensuring that only valid roles are used and that messages are formatted correctly. The template includes logic for handling function calls, specifying how to format them in JSON and ensuring they adhere to a given schema. This file provides a narrow functionality focused on message processing and function call generation, which is crucial for applications that require dynamic interaction with external functions or APIs. Its relevance to a codebase lies in its ability to automate and standardize the generation of structured data, enhancing the application's ability to interact with other components or services.
# Content Summary
This file is a Jinja2 template script used for processing and generating structured messages within a conversational AI system. It is designed to handle different roles in a conversation, such as 'system', 'user', 'assistant', and 'tool', ensuring that each message is processed according to its role. The script sets up a system prompt that guides the assistant on how to respond to user queries, either by using internal knowledge or by calling external functions when necessary.

Key technical details include:

1. **Role Management**: The script defines and checks for valid roles ('system', 'user', 'assistant', 'tool') to ensure that messages are processed correctly. It raises exceptions if an invalid role is encountered.

2. **Function Call Logic**: The template includes logic for deciding when to call external functions. It specifies that functions should be called if the response requires external information, and these calls should be formatted as a JSON list prefixed with a 'functools' marker.

3. **JSON Schema Compliance**: The script emphasizes adherence to a provided JSON schema for function calls, ensuring that arguments and values are formatted correctly, such as using float formatting for numbers.

4. **Message Formatting**: Each message is wrapped with specific header and end markers (`<|start_header_id|>` and `<|end_header_id|>`) to delineate message boundaries. This is crucial for maintaining the structure and flow of the conversation.

5. **System Prompt Construction**: The system prompt is dynamically constructed, incorporating available functions and the current date, which is appended to the prompt to provide context.

6. **Error Handling**: The script includes basic consistency checks, such as ensuring that the message list is not empty and that roles are valid, raising exceptions when these conditions are not met.

This template is essential for developers working on conversational AI systems, as it provides a structured approach to managing dialogue flow and integrating external function calls seamlessly.
