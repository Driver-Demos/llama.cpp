# Purpose
The provided content appears to be a Jinja2 template used for processing and validating a sequence of messages in a conversational context. This template checks the roles of the messages, ensuring they alternate correctly between 'user' and 'assistant', and raises exceptions if the roles do not follow the expected pattern. It also formats each message by appending specific markers, such as `<start_of_turn>` and `<end_of_turn>`, to delineate the beginning and end of each message turn. Additionally, the template includes logic to handle the role designation, converting 'assistant' to 'model' for internal processing. This setup is likely used in a conversational AI or chatbot system to ensure the integrity and proper formatting of message exchanges.
