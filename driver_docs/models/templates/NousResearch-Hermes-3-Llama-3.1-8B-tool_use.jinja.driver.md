# Purpose
The provided content is a Jinja2 template file that defines a macro for converting JSON schema types to Python types. This file is used to facilitate the transformation of JSON data types into their corresponding Python data types, which is essential for generating Python code that can handle JSON data structures. The macro `json_to_python_type` maps basic JSON types like "string", "number", "integer", and "boolean" to Python's `str`, `float`, `int`, and `bool`, respectively. It also handles complex types such as arrays and objects, converting them into Python's `list` and `dict` types, and supports union types and iterables. This file provides a narrow functionality focused on type conversion, which is crucial for applications that need to dynamically generate Python code from JSON schemas, ensuring type safety and compatibility within the codebase.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a Jinja2 template that defines a macro named `json_to_python_type`. This macro is designed to convert JSON schema types into their corresponding Python types. The macro uses a mapping dictionary, `basic_type_map`, to translate basic JSON types such as "string", "number", "integer", and "boolean" into Python's `str`, `float`, `int`, and `bool` types, respectively.

The macro handles complex JSON types as well. For arrays, it recursively calls itself to determine the type of the array's items and wraps it in a Python `list[]` type. For objects, it checks if `additionalProperties` is defined in the JSON schema to determine if it should map to a `dict[str, <type>]` or a generic `dict`. If the JSON type is iterable, it constructs a Python `Union[]` type to represent multiple possible types. If none of these conditions are met, it defaults to returning `Any`, indicating an unspecified type.

Additionally, the template includes a system message for a function-calling AI model, detailing how to handle function signatures and calls within XML tags. It provides a structure for defining available tools, including their names, descriptions, parameters, and return types, using the `json_to_python_type` macro to convert JSON schema types to Python types. The template also specifies the format for function call responses using a Pydantic model JSON schema.

This template is crucial for developers working with AI models that need to interpret and convert JSON schema types to Python types, especially in the context of generating or processing function calls dynamically. It ensures that the AI model can accurately map JSON data structures to Python, facilitating seamless integration and interaction with Python-based systems.
