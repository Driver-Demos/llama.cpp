# Purpose
This file appears to be a Jinja2 template used for generating dynamic content, likely in the context of a conversational AI or chatbot system. It is designed to format and structure messages exchanged between different roles, such as "system," "user," and "assistant," within a dialogue. The template includes conditional logic to handle the presence of tools, which are functions that the assistant can call to assist with user queries. These tools are represented in JSON format and wrapped in XML-like tags for structured communication. The file's content is crucial for ensuring that the dialogue system can dynamically generate and format messages, manage tool calls, and maintain a coherent conversation flow, making it a vital component of the codebase's messaging infrastructure.
# Content Summary
This file is a template script designed to format and manage interactions between a system, user, and an assistant named Qwen, which is created by Alibaba Cloud. The script is structured to handle different roles and their corresponding messages, including system, user, assistant, and tool roles. It uses conditional logic to determine the content and format of the output based on the presence of tools and the role of the message.

Key functionalities include:

1. **Role-Based Message Formatting**: The script formats messages based on their role. For system messages, it checks if the first message is from the system and includes its content. If not, it defaults to a predefined message introducing Qwen. User and assistant messages are wrapped with specific tags to denote their role.

2. **Tool Integration**: If tools are available, the script provides a mechanism to call functions to assist with user queries. It outputs function signatures within `<tools></tools>` XML tags and expects function calls to be returned as JSON objects within `<tool_call></tool_call>` tags. This allows the assistant to interact with external tools and return structured responses.

3. **Assistant Responses**: The assistant's responses can include content and tool calls. If tool calls are present, they are formatted as JSON objects specifying the function name and arguments. This ensures that the assistant can execute and respond with the results of these tool calls.

4. **Tool Responses**: Messages from tools are encapsulated within `<tool_response></tool_response>` tags, and the script manages the transition between user and tool messages to maintain a coherent conversation flow.

5. **Dynamic Content Handling**: The script uses Jinja templating to dynamically insert content and handle loops over messages and tools, allowing for flexible and context-sensitive message generation.

Overall, this script is crucial for managing the flow of information and interactions in a system where an assistant interacts with users and tools, ensuring that each component's output is correctly formatted and integrated into the conversation.
