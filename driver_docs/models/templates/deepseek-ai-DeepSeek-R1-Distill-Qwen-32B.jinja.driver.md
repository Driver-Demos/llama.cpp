# Purpose
The provided content is a Jinja2 template script used for processing and formatting messages in a conversational AI or chatbot system. It defines a series of conditional and loop structures to iterate over a collection of messages, categorizing them based on their roles such as 'system', 'user', 'assistant', and 'tool'. The script sets up a namespace to manage state variables like `is_first`, `is_tool`, and `is_output_first`, which help control the flow and formatting of the output. It constructs the output by appending specific tokens and formatting elements, such as JSON blocks for tool calls, to ensure the messages are correctly structured for further processing or display. This template is crucial for maintaining the logical flow and clarity of interactions within the system, ensuring that each message is appropriately tagged and formatted.
