# Purpose
This code appears to be a template script written in a templating language, likely Jinja2, used for generating dynamic content based on a set of input messages. It provides a narrow functionality focused on processing and formatting messages from different roles (such as 'system', 'user', 'assistant', and 'tool') into a structured output. The script includes logic to handle different message types, manage state with namespace variables, and format the output with specific tokens and markers. This file is not an executable or a library but rather a configuration or template file intended to be used within a larger system to generate formatted text outputs based on input data.
