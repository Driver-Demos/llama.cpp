# Purpose
This file is a Jinja2 template used for rendering dynamic content, likely within a Python-based application. It is designed to configure the output of a conversational AI system, specifically managing how messages and system prompts are structured and displayed. The template includes conditional logic to handle various scenarios, such as the presence of custom tools, date formatting, and message roles, ensuring that the output is tailored to the current context. The file's content is crucial for maintaining the flow and format of interactions within the application, providing a structured way to integrate system messages, user inputs, and tool functionalities. This template plays a narrow but essential role in the codebase by ensuring consistent and contextually appropriate communication between the system and its users.
# Content Summary
This configuration file is a Jinja2 template designed to process and format messages within a system that appears to handle communication between different roles, such as 'system', 'user', 'assistant', and 'ipython'. The template is structured to dynamically set and manage variables, such as `tools`, `tools_in_user_message`, and `date_string`, based on the conditions defined within the template.

Key functionalities include:

1. **Tool Configuration**: The template checks if `custom_tools` is defined and assigns it to the `tools` variable. If `tools` is not defined, it defaults to `none`. This allows for dynamic inclusion of custom tools based on the context.

2. **Date Management**: The template sets a `date_string` variable, which defaults to the current date using `strftime_now` if available, or a hardcoded date ("26 Jul 2024") if not. This ensures that the template can always provide a current or default date.

3. **Message Handling**: The template processes a list of messages, extracting and formatting them based on their role. It specifically handles 'system' messages by extracting the content and removing it from the message list. It also formats messages for 'user', 'assistant', and 'ipython' roles, ensuring that each message is encapsulated with specific header and footer identifiers.

4. **Function Call Formatting**: If tools are available and not included in the user message, the template provides instructions for responding with JSON-formatted function calls. This includes specifying the function name and parameters, ensuring that responses are structured correctly for function execution.

5. **Error Handling**: The template includes error handling mechanisms, such as raising exceptions if certain conditions are not met, like when there are no user messages to include tools or when multiple tool calls are detected in a message.

Overall, this template is designed to facilitate structured communication and function execution within a system, ensuring that messages are processed and formatted consistently while allowing for dynamic configuration based on the context.
