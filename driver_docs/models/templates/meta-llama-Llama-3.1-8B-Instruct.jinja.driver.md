# Purpose
The provided content is a Jinja2 template used for generating structured text, likely for a conversational AI or chatbot system. This template configures the output format by setting variables and conditions to dynamically insert data, such as custom tools, system messages, and user messages, into a predefined structure. The file's functionality is narrow, focusing on the generation of formatted text blocks that include metadata like environment settings, tool availability, and message content. The template handles multiple conceptual components, such as system messages, user messages, and tool calls, all unified by the theme of preparing structured communication for a conversational interface. This file is crucial in a codebase for ensuring consistent and accurate message formatting, which is essential for the correct operation of the AI system it supports.
# Content Summary
This configuration file is a Jinja2 template used for processing and formatting messages within a software system that likely involves interaction with tools and user inputs. The template is designed to handle various scenarios based on the presence and definition of certain variables, such as `custom_tools`, `tools_in_user_message`, `date_string`, and `tools`.

Key functionalities of the template include:

1. **Tool Configuration**: The template checks if `custom_tools` is defined and assigns it to the `tools` variable. If `tools` is not defined, it defaults to `none`. This allows for dynamic configuration of tools based on the context in which the template is used.

2. **Date Management**: The template sets a default `date_string` to "26 Jul 2024" if it is not already defined. This is used to insert the current date into the output, providing context for time-sensitive operations.

3. **System Message Handling**: The template extracts the system message from the first message in the `messages` list if the role is 'system'. This message is then formatted and included in the output, ensuring that system-level instructions or information are appropriately communicated.

4. **Tool and Environment Information**: If `builtin_tools` or `tools` are defined, the template includes information about the environment (set to "ipython") and lists available tools, excluding any tool named 'code_interpreter'. This provides clarity on the tools available for use in the current context.

5. **Function Call Guidance**: When tools are available and not included in the user message, the template provides instructions on how to call functions using JSON format. This includes specifying the function name and its parameters, ensuring that users or systems interacting with the template can execute functions correctly.

6. **Message Processing**: The template processes each message in the `messages` list, formatting them based on their role (e.g., 'user', 'assistant', 'ipython'). It handles tool calls by ensuring only single tool calls are supported and formats them according to whether they are built-in or custom.

7. **Error Handling**: The template includes error handling for scenarios such as attempting to place tools in a user message when no user message exists or when multiple tool calls are detected, which are not supported.

Overall, this template is a sophisticated mechanism for managing and formatting interactions within a system that involves tool usage and message processing, ensuring that all components are correctly configured and communicated.
