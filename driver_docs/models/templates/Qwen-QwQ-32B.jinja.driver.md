# Purpose
The provided content appears to be a Jinja2 template used for generating structured text, likely in a conversational AI or chatbot system. This template is designed to format messages and interactions between different roles, such as "system," "user," "assistant," and "tool," using custom tags like `<|im_start|>` and `<|im_end|>`. It includes logic to handle the presence of tools, allowing the assistant to call functions and return results in a structured JSON format within XML-like tags. The template's primary purpose is to ensure that the communication flow is well-organized and that function calls and responses are clearly delineated, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of interactions in a dynamic, automated environment. This file is integral to the codebase as it dictates how messages are formatted and processed, ensuring consistent and accurate communication between components.
# Content Summary
This file appears to be a Jinja2 template used for processing and formatting messages and tool interactions within a software system. The template is designed to handle different roles such as "system," "user," "assistant," and "tool," and it structures the output using custom delimiters like `<|im_start|>` and `<|im_end|>` to demarcate sections of content.

Key functionalities include:

1. **Conditional Tool Handling**: The template checks for the presence of tools and, if available, formats them within `<tools></tools>` XML tags. Each tool is serialized into JSON format using the `tojson` filter, which is crucial for ensuring that the tool data is correctly structured for further processing.

2. **Function Call Formatting**: When tools are available, the template provides instructions for making function calls. It specifies that each function call should be returned as a JSON object with the function name and arguments, encapsulated within `<tool_call></tool_call>` XML tags. This structured approach facilitates the integration of tool functionalities into the system's workflow.

3. **Message Role Processing**: The template iterates over a list of messages, handling each based on its role. For "system" and "user" roles, it formats the content with the custom delimiters. For "assistant" roles, it processes tool calls if present, appending them to the message content. This ensures that the assistant's responses are comprehensive and include any necessary tool interactions.

4. **Tool Response Handling**: For messages with the "tool" role, the template wraps the content in `<tool_response></tool_response>` tags, ensuring that tool outputs are clearly delineated from other message types.

5. **Prompt Generation**: At the end of the template, there is a conditional block that adds a generation prompt for the assistant, enclosed in `<think>` tags, if the `add_generation_prompt` flag is set. This feature likely supports scenarios where the assistant needs to generate additional content or responses.

Overall, this template is a sophisticated mechanism for managing and formatting interactions between different components of a software system, ensuring that messages and tool interactions are clearly structured and easily interpretable by downstream processes.
