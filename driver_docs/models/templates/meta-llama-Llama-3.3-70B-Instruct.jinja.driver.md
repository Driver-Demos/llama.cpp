# Purpose
This file appears to be a Jinja2 template used for generating structured text, likely in a markdown or similar format, for a software application. It is designed to dynamically configure and render content based on the presence and values of certain variables, such as `custom_tools`, `tools_in_user_message`, and `date_string`. The template includes conditional logic to determine the inclusion of specific sections, such as system messages, tool information, and user messages, which suggests its role in customizing the output for different scenarios or environments. The file's content is relevant to a codebase as it automates the generation of documentation or configuration outputs, ensuring consistency and adaptability across different deployments or use cases. The use of placeholders and control structures indicates a focus on flexibility and reusability within the software's documentation or configuration processes.
# Content Summary
This configuration file is a Jinja2 template designed to process and format messages within a software system, likely for a conversational AI or chatbot application. The template uses conditional logic and variable assignments to manage the inclusion and formatting of system and user messages, as well as tool-related information.

Key technical details include:

1. **Variable Initialization and Defaults**: The template initializes several variables with default values if they are not already defined. For example, `tools_in_user_message` is set to `true`, `date_string` is set to "26 Jul 2024", and `tools` is set to `none` if not defined. This ensures that the template has a consistent state regardless of the input.

2. **System Message Handling**: The template checks if the first message in the `messages` list has a role of 'system'. If so, it extracts and trims the system message content and removes it from the list. This allows the system message to be processed separately from user messages.

3. **Tool Configuration**: The template handles both built-in and custom tools. If `builtin_tools` is defined, it lists these tools, excluding any named 'code_interpreter'. If custom tools are provided, they are processed and formatted for inclusion in user messages, with guidance on how to respond using JSON for function calls.

4. **Message Formatting**: The template formats messages with specific headers and footers, such as `<|start_header_id|>` and `<|eot_id|>`, to delineate different sections. This is crucial for parsing and processing messages correctly in the system.

5. **Tool Call Handling**: The template supports single tool calls within messages. It raises an exception if multiple tool calls are detected, ensuring that only one tool call is processed at a time. The tool call is formatted differently depending on whether it is a built-in tool or a custom tool.

6. **Iterative Message Processing**: The template iterates over remaining messages, formatting them based on their role. It handles roles such as 'ipython', 'tool', and others, ensuring that each message is appropriately processed and formatted.

7. **Error Handling**: The template includes error handling mechanisms, such as raising exceptions when certain conditions are not met (e.g., no first user message when required, or multiple tool calls).

Overall, this template is a sophisticated configuration file that manages the flow and formatting of messages and tool interactions within a software system, ensuring that all components are correctly initialized, processed, and formatted for further use.
