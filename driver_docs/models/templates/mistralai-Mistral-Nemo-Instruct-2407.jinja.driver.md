# Purpose
The provided content is a Jinja2 template used for processing and formatting messages in a conversational AI system. This template is designed to handle different roles within a conversation, such as "user," "assistant," "tool," and "tool_results," ensuring that the conversation follows a specific structure. It checks for the correct alternation of user and assistant messages and raises exceptions if the sequence is incorrect. Additionally, it formats tool-related messages and results, embedding them within specific markers like "[AVAILABLE_TOOLS]" and "[TOOL_RESULTS]." The template's primary purpose is to ensure that the conversation flow is maintained correctly and that any tool interactions are properly formatted and validated, making it a crucial component for managing dialogue in an AI-driven application.
# Content Summary
This configuration file is a Jinja2 template script designed to process and format a sequence of messages, typically used in a conversational AI or chatbot system. The script handles messages with different roles, such as "system," "user," "assistant," "tool," and "tool_results," and ensures that the conversation follows a specific structure.

Key technical details include:

1. **Message Role Handling**: The script begins by checking if the first message is a "system" message. If so, it sets this as the `system_message` and processes the remaining messages as `loop_messages`. If not, all messages are treated as `loop_messages`.

2. **Tool Availability**: It checks if `tools` are defined; if not, it sets `tools` to `none`. This is crucial for determining if tool-related processing is necessary later in the script.

3. **User Message Selection**: The script filters messages to create a list of `user_messages` by selecting messages with the role "user."

4. **Role Alternation Validation**: A critical part of the script is ensuring that after an optional system message, the roles alternate between "user" and "assistant." If this alternation is violated, an exception is raised.

5. **Tool and Tool Call Processing**: The script processes tool-related messages, formatting them into JSON structures. It checks for the presence of tool calls and validates that tool call IDs are alphanumeric strings of length 9, raising exceptions if these conditions are not met.

6. **Message Formatting**: The script formats messages into specific structures, such as `[INST]` for user messages and `[TOOL_CALLS]` or `[TOOL_RESULTS]` for tool-related messages. It appends tokens like `bos_token` and `eos_token` to denote the beginning and end of sequences.

7. **Exception Handling**: The script includes several checks that raise exceptions if certain conditions are not met, such as incorrect role alternation or invalid tool call IDs.

This template is essential for ensuring that the conversation flow adheres to predefined rules and formats, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity and functionality of the conversational system.
