# Purpose
This file appears to be a Jinja2 template used for generating dynamic content, likely in a web application or a document generation context. It provides a narrow functionality focused on rendering messages and tool interactions based on the roles of 'user', 'assistant', and 'tool'. The file uses control structures such as conditionals and loops to manage the flow of content, and it includes placeholders for dynamic data insertion. The relevance of this file to a codebase lies in its ability to automate the generation of structured outputs, which can be crucial for applications that require dynamic content rendering based on user interactions or system states.
# Content Summary
This file is a Jinja2 template script used for processing and formatting messages in a conversational AI system. It is designed to handle different roles within a conversation, such as 'system', 'user', 'assistant', and 'tool', and to manage the flow of messages between these roles. 

Key technical details include:

1. **Conditional Initialization**: The script checks if the variable `add_generation_prompt` is defined. If not, it initializes it to `false`. This variable likely controls whether a generation prompt is added at the end of processing.

2. **Namespace Management**: A namespace `ns` is created to track the state of the conversation, including flags like `is_first`, `is_tool_outputs`, and `is_output_first`, as well as storing the `system_prompt`.

3. **Message Processing**: The script iterates over a list of `messages`, extracting and setting the `system_prompt` from messages with the role 'system'. It formats user messages by wrapping them with specific tokens and processes assistant messages differently based on whether they contain content or tool calls.

4. **Tool Call Syntax**: If tools are available, the script provides a template for calling function tools, including an example syntax for JSON-formatted tool calls. This is crucial for integrating external functions into the conversation flow.

5. **Tool Output Management**: The script includes a macro `flush_tool_outputs` to manage the state of tool outputs, ensuring that tool output sections are properly closed and formatted.

6. **Role-Specific Formatting**: Each role in the conversation is formatted with specific tokens to delineate the start and end of messages, ensuring clear separation and processing of different message types.

7. **End of Processing**: If `add_generation_prompt` is true and no tool outputs are pending, the script appends a generation prompt, indicating readiness for further processing or response generation.

This template is essential for developers working on conversational AI systems, as it provides a structured way to handle and format interactions between different components of the system.
