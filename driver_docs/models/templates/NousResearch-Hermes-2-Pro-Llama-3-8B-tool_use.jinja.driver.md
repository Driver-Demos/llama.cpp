# Purpose
The provided content is a Jinja2 template file that defines a macro for converting JSON schema types to Python types. This file is used to facilitate the transformation of JSON data types into their corresponding Python data types, which is essential for generating Python code that can handle JSON data structures. The macro `json_to_python_type` maps basic JSON types like "string", "number", "integer", and "boolean" to Python's `str`, `float`, `int`, and `bool`, respectively. It also handles complex types such as arrays and objects, converting them into Python's `list` and `dict` types, and supports union types using Python's `Union`. This file provides a narrow functionality focused on type conversion, which is crucial for applications that need to dynamically generate Python code from JSON schemas, ensuring type safety and compatibility within the codebase.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a Jinja2 template that defines a macro named `json_to_python_type`. This macro is designed to convert JSON schema types into their corresponding Python types. The macro uses a mapping dictionary, `basic_type_map`, to translate basic JSON types such as "string", "number", "integer", and "boolean" into Python's `str`, `float`, `int`, and `bool` types, respectively.

The macro handles more complex JSON types as follows:
- For JSON arrays, it recursively calls itself to determine the type of the array's items and returns a Python `list` type with the appropriate item type.
- For JSON objects, it checks if `additionalProperties` is defined. If so, it returns a `dict` with string keys and values of the type specified by `additionalProperties`. If not, it defaults to a generic `dict`.
- If the JSON type is iterable (i.e., a list of types), it constructs a Python `Union` type, recursively determining the Python type for each JSON type in the list.
- If none of the above conditions are met, it defaults to returning `Any`, indicating an unspecified or unknown type.

Additionally, the template includes a section that appears to be part of a larger system for generating function call documentation. It uses the macro to convert JSON schema definitions of function parameters and return types into Python type annotations. This section is structured to output function signatures and descriptions, including arguments and return types, formatted for a function-calling AI model. The template also outlines how to format function call responses using XML-like tags and JSON objects.

Overall, this template is a utility for converting JSON schema types to Python types and generating structured documentation for function calls, which can be particularly useful in systems that involve dynamic function invocation and type checking.
