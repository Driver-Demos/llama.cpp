# Purpose
This code is a Jinja2 template file that defines macros for converting JSON schema types to Python types and for generating Python function signatures based on tool specifications. The `json_to_python_type` macro maps JSON data types to their corresponding Python types, handling basic types, arrays, objects, and unions. The `old_tool_parser` and `new_tool_parser` macros generate Python function definitions from tool specifications, including parameter types and descriptions, and are designed to handle different versions of tool specifications. This file provides a narrow functionality focused on code generation for tool integration, likely intended to be used as part of a larger system that dynamically generates Python code based on JSON specifications.
