# Purpose
The provided content appears to be a Jinja2 template used for processing and formatting messages in a conversational AI or chatbot system. This template is designed to handle different roles such as "system," "user," "assistant," and "tool," and it structures the output using custom tags like `<|im_start|>` and `<|im_end|>`. The template facilitates the integration of tool functions by embedding function signatures within `<tools>` XML tags and formatting function calls as JSON objects within `<tool_call>` tags. It also manages multi-step interactions by tracking user queries and responses, ensuring that the conversation flow is maintained correctly. This file plays a crucial role in the codebase by defining how messages are processed, formatted, and presented, enabling seamless interaction between the user and the system.
# Content Summary
This configuration file is a Jinja2 template designed to process and format messages and tool interactions within a conversational AI system. The template is structured to handle different roles such as "system," "user," "assistant," and "tool," and it formats the output using custom tags like `<|im_start|>` and `<|im_end|>` to delineate message boundaries.

Key functionalities include:

1. **Tool Integration**: If tools are available, the template generates a section that lists function signatures within `<tools></tools>` XML tags. It allows the assistant to call these functions by returning a JSON object with the function name and arguments encapsulated within `<tool_call></tool_call>` tags.

2. **Message Processing**: The template iterates over a list of messages, processing each based on its role. For "system" and "user" roles, it formats the content with start and end tags. For "assistant" messages, it handles optional reasoning content, which can be separated from the main content using `<think>` tags.

3. **Multi-step Tool Handling**: The template includes logic to determine if a multi-step tool interaction is occurring, adjusting the processing of messages accordingly. It tracks the last user query index to manage the flow of conversation and tool calls.

4. **Tool Response Handling**: For messages with the "tool" role, the template formats the content within `<tool_response>` tags, ensuring that tool responses are clearly delineated from other message types.

5. **Conditional Prompts**: The template can append additional prompts for the assistant role, with optional thinking sections, based on configuration flags like `add_generation_prompt` and `enable_thinking`.

This template is essential for developers working on conversational AI systems that require structured message formatting and tool interaction management. It ensures that messages are processed consistently and that tool calls are correctly formatted and integrated into the conversation flow.
