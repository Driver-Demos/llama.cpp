# Purpose
The file content indicates a configuration setting for an EditorConfig file, where `root = true` specifies that this is the root configuration file. This setting prevents EditorConfig from searching for any further configuration files in parent directories, ensuring that the settings defined in this file are the definitive ones for the project.
