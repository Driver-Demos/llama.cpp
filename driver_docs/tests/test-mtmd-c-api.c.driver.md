# Purpose
This C source code file serves as a test harness for the `libmtmd` C API, which appears to be a library for handling multimedia data, specifically text and image chunks. The code is structured as an executable program, indicated by the presence of the [`main`](#main) function, which is the entry point for execution. The primary purpose of this file is to validate the functionality of the `libmtmd` library by creating input chunks, determining their types, and processing them accordingly. It demonstrates the use of the library's API functions to handle different types of data, such as text and image tokens, and outputs relevant information about these data chunks to the console.

The code includes several key technical components, such as the creation and management of `mtmd_input_chunks`, and the retrieval and processing of tokens from these chunks. It uses assertions to ensure the integrity of the data being processed, such as checking that the number of tokens is greater than zero and that pointers are not null. The file does not define public APIs or external interfaces itself but rather utilizes the `libmtmd` API to perform its operations. This test program is essential for verifying that the library functions as expected, providing a practical example of how to interact with the `libmtmd` API for potential developers or users of the library.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function tests the libmtmd C API by creating input chunks, processing them based on their type, and printing relevant information about each chunk.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Prints a message indicating the start of the libmtmd C API test.
    - Initializes default context parameters and prints the default image marker.
    - Creates input chunks using `mtmd_test_create_input_chunks` and checks for successful creation.
    - Retrieves the number of chunks and asserts that it is greater than zero.
    - Iterates over each chunk, retrieves its type, and prints the type information.
    - For text chunks, retrieves and prints the number of tokens and each token value, asserting that tokens are valid.
    - For image chunks, retrieves and prints the number of tokens, image dimensions, and image ID, asserting that these values are valid.
    - Frees the allocated input chunks.
    - Prints a message indicating the completion of the test.
- **Output**: The function returns 0 on successful execution, or 1 if input chunk creation fails.
