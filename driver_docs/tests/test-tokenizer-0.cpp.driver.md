# Purpose
This C++ source code file is designed to perform tokenization tests on text data using a vocabulary model. The code is structured to read input and output files containing test cases, tokenize the input text using a specified vocabulary, and compare the results against expected token sequences. The file includes functions to read test data from files, tokenize text using a multi-threaded approach, and validate the tokenization results. The main function orchestrates the process by loading a vocabulary model, initializing a context for tokenization, and executing tests either from provided files or directly from text input. The code is intended to be executed as a standalone program, as indicated by the presence of a [`main`](#main) function, and it provides detailed error messages and output to the console for debugging and verification purposes.

The code imports several headers, including custom headers like "llama.h", "common.h", and "console.h", which suggest that it relies on external libraries or components for its functionality. The primary technical components include the [`read_tests`](#read_tests) function for reading and parsing test data, the use of multi-threading to perform tokenization in parallel, and the integration with a vocabulary model through functions like `llama_model_load_from_file` and `common_tokenize`. The code defines a public API for executing tokenization tests, and it is structured to handle different scenarios, such as reading from files or processing direct text input. The use of multi-threading and detailed error handling indicates a focus on performance and robustness in testing the tokenization process.

# Functions

---
### read\_tests<!-- {{#callable:read_tests}} -->
The `read_tests` function reads input and output test data from specified files, processes them into a map of input strings to vectors of tokens, and returns this map.
- **Inputs**:
    - `fname_inp`: The name of the input file containing raw test data, expected to be a string.
    - `fname_out`: The name of the output file containing expected tokenized results, expected to be a string.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize an empty `llama_tests` map to store the test data.
    - Attempt to open the input file `fname_inp` using an `ifstream`; if it fails, print an error message and return the empty map.
    - Read the entire content of the input file into a string `sraw`.
    - Attempt to open the output file `fname_out` using an `ifstream`; if it fails, print an error message and return the empty map.
    - Read each line from the output file into a vector `sout`.
    - Define a separator string `sep` to split the input data into individual tests.
    - Iterate over `sraw` to split it into individual test strings using the separator `sep`, storing them in a vector `sinp`.
    - Check if the number of input tests (`sinp`) matches the number of output tests (`sout`); if not, print an error message and return the empty map.
    - For each pair of input and output test strings, strip the output string and convert it into a vector of `llama_token` integers.
    - Store each input string and its corresponding vector of tokens in the `tests` map.
    - Return the populated `tests` map.
- **Output**: A `llama_tests` map, which is a mapping of input strings to vectors of `llama_token` integers, representing the tokenized output.

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a llama model, performs tokenization tests using multi-threading, and optionally tokenizes a provided text file, outputting results and success status.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of C-style strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the number of arguments is less than 2; if so, print usage information and return 1.
    - Extract the vocabulary file name from the command-line arguments and construct input and output file names.
    - Initialize the llama backend and load the vocabulary model from the specified file.
    - If the model fails to load, print an error message and return 1.
    - Initialize the llama context from the loaded model; if it fails, print an error message, free the model, and return 1.
    - If on Windows, initialize console support for Unicode and set up cleanup on exit.
    - Define a lambda function to read test cases from input and output files unless a text file is provided.
    - Determine the number of hardware threads available and create a vector of threads for multi-threaded tokenization.
    - For each thread, perform tokenization tests and print results only from the first thread; check if the tokenization results match expected results and update success status accordingly.
    - Join all threads to ensure completion of multi-threaded operations.
    - If a text file is provided, read its content, tokenize it, and write the tokens to an output file.
    - Free the llama model and context, and clean up the llama backend.
    - Print whether the tests passed or failed and return 0 if successful, otherwise return 3.
- **Output**: Returns 0 if all tests pass or 3 if any test fails, with intermediate returns of 1 for various error conditions.
