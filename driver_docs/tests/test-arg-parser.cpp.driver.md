# Purpose
This C++ source code file is a test suite designed to validate the functionality of an argument parser and related components within a software system. The primary focus of the code is to ensure that there are no duplicate arguments or environment variables across different examples, and to verify the correct parsing of command-line arguments and environment variables. The code is structured to test both invalid and valid usage scenarios, using assertions to confirm expected outcomes. It also includes tests for environment variable handling, ensuring that command-line arguments can override environment settings. Additionally, the code contains conditional compilation to skip certain tests on Windows systems due to the lack of support for specific functions like `setenv`.

The file also includes tests for network-related functions, specifically those that involve fetching content from URLs using the `curl` library. These tests check for successful content retrieval, handling of bad URLs, and error conditions such as exceeding maximum content size or timeouts. The presence of these tests indicates that the code is part of a broader system that may involve remote data fetching. The use of assertions throughout the code ensures that any failure in the expected behavior will be immediately flagged, making it a robust tool for maintaining the integrity of the argument parsing and network functionalities.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function tests the argument parser for duplicate arguments, invalid and valid usage, environment variable handling, and curl-related functions.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `common_params` object `params`.
    - Print a message indicating the start of duplicate argument checks.
    - Iterate over all examples defined by `LLAMA_EXAMPLE_COUNT`.
    - For each example, initialize argument parsing context and check for duplicate arguments and environment variables, exiting on duplicates.
    - Catch and handle exceptions during argument parsing initialization.
    - Define a lambda function `list_str_to_char` to convert a vector of strings to a vector of char pointers.
    - Test invalid argument usage scenarios and assert expected failures.
    - Test valid argument usage scenarios and assert expected successes.
    - Check environment variable handling, including invalid values and overwriting, with assertions.
    - If not on Windows, test environment variable parsing and overwriting.
    - Check if curl is available and test URL fetching, handling good and bad URLs, and testing for max size and timeout errors.
    - Print a final message indicating all tests passed.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it performs tests and assertions to validate argument parsing functionality.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`common_params_parser_init`](../common/arg.cpp.driver.md#common_params_parser_init)
    - [`common_params_parse`](../common/arg.cpp.driver.md#common_params_parse)
