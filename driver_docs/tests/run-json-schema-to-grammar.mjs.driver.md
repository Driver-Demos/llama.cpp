# Purpose
This code is a Node.js script that provides a specific functionality: it reads a JSON schema file, processes it using a `SchemaConverter` to resolve references, and then converts it into a grammar format, which is subsequently printed to the console. The script is designed to be executed from the command line, as indicated by its use of `process.argv` to capture command-line arguments. It imports the `readFileSync` function from the Node.js `fs` module to read the file contents and utilizes a `SchemaConverter` class from an external module to perform the conversion. This script is narrowly focused on transforming JSON schema files into a grammar format, likely for use in applications that require such a transformation for further processing or validation tasks.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fs`
- `../tools/server/public_legacy/json-schema-to-grammar.mjs`


# Global Variables

---
### schema
- **Type**: `object`
- **Description**: The `schema` variable is a global object that initially holds the parsed JSON content of a file specified by the user. It is then processed by the `SchemaConverter` to resolve references and prepare it for further operations.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and manipulate the JSON schema data, which is then converted into a grammar format by the `SchemaConverter`.


---
### converter
- **Type**: `SchemaConverter`
- **Description**: The `converter` variable is an instance of the `SchemaConverter` class, which is imported from a module that handles the conversion of JSON schemas to a grammar format. It is initialized with an empty object as its configuration.
- **Use**: This variable is used to resolve references within a JSON schema and to convert the schema into a grammar format for further processing or output.
