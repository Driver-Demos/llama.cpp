# Purpose
This C++ source code file is designed to benchmark quantization-specific functions using synthetic data. It is an executable program that provides a focused functionality, primarily aimed at evaluating the performance of various quantization and dequantization operations. The code includes several key components, such as the generation of synthetic data, alignment of memory with offsets, and the benchmarking of functions through repeated iterations to measure performance in terms of CPU cycles and throughput. The program supports command-line arguments to customize the benchmarking process, allowing users to specify test sizes, operations, data types, alignment offsets, and the number of iterations.

The code is structured around a main function that initializes parameters, processes command-line arguments, and executes the benchmarking for different quantization operations. It utilizes the GGML library for handling quantization and dequantization operations, leveraging its type traits and conversion functions. The program defines a `quantize_perf_params` structure to store configuration settings and uses a series of static functions to perform data generation, alignment, and benchmarking. The benchmarking results are outputted to the console, providing insights into the performance of the quantization functions in terms of cycles per value and throughput in gigabytes per second.

# Functions

---
### cpu\_cycles<!-- {{#callable:cpu_cycles}} -->
The `cpu_cycles` function returns the current CPU cycle count using either the `__rdtscp` or `__rdtsc` instruction, depending on CPU capabilities.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the `__POPCNT__` macro is defined to determine if the CPU supports the `__rdtscp` instruction.
    - If `__POPCNT__` is defined, declare an unsigned integer `dummy` and return the result of `__rdtscp(&dummy)`.
    - If `__POPCNT__` is not defined, return the result of `__rdtsc()`.
- **Output**: Returns an `int64_t` representing the current CPU cycle count.


---
### generate\_data<!-- {{#callable:generate_data}} -->
The `generate_data` function populates an array with synthetic data based on a cosine function with a specified offset.
- **Inputs**:
    - `offset`: A float value that is added to the index in the cosine function to generate data.
    - `n`: The number of elements to generate in the destination array.
    - `dst`: A pointer to a float array where the generated data will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Iterates over a loop from 0 to n-1.
    - For each iteration, calculates the value using the formula `0.1 + 2*cosf(i + offset)` and assigns it to the corresponding index in the destination array `dst`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the array pointed to by `dst` in place.


---
### gigabytes\_per\_second<!-- {{#callable:gigabytes_per_second}} -->
The `gigabytes_per_second` function calculates the data transfer rate in gigabytes per second given the number of bytes transferred and the time taken in microseconds.
- **Inputs**:
    - `bytes`: The number of bytes transferred.
    - `usecs`: The time taken for the transfer in microseconds.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes two parameters: `bytes` and `usecs`.
    - It converts `usecs` to seconds by dividing by 1,000,000.
    - It calculates the transfer rate in bytes per second by dividing `bytes` by the converted `usecs`.
    - It converts the transfer rate from bytes per second to gigabytes per second by dividing by 1,073,741,824 (1024*1024*1024).
- **Output**: A float representing the data transfer rate in gigabytes per second.


---
### align\_with\_offset<!-- {{#callable:align_with_offset}} -->

- **Inputs**:
    - `ptr`: A pointer to the memory location that needs to be aligned.
    - `offset`: An integer value representing the additional offset to be applied after alignment.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Define a dummy size as four times the maximum alignment value (256 bytes).
    - Use the `std::align` function to align the pointer `ptr` to the `MAX_ALIGNMENT` boundary, adjusting the pointer within the `dummy_size` range.
    - Cast the aligned pointer to a `char*` and add the specified `offset` to it.
