# Purpose
This code is a simple C header file that declares a function prototype for [`get_model_or_exit`](#get_model_or_exit). The function takes two parameters: an integer and an array of character pointers, which typically represent command-line arguments. The function is expected to return a pointer to a character, likely a string, and its name suggests that it retrieves a model or terminates the program if unsuccessful. The use of `#pragma once` ensures that the header file is included only once in a single compilation, preventing potential issues with multiple inclusions.
# Global Variables

---
### get\_model\_or\_exit
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: `get_model_or_exit` is a function pointer that takes an integer and an array of character pointers as arguments and returns a character pointer. It is declared at the top level, indicating it is a global function accessible throughout the program.
- **Use**: This function is used to retrieve a model based on the provided arguments, and it will terminate the program if the model cannot be retrieved.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### get\_model\_or\_exit<!-- {{#callable_declaration:get_model_or_exit}} -->
Retrieve the model file path or exit if not provided.
- **Description**: This function retrieves the model file path from the command line arguments or from an environment variable if no arguments are provided. It is intended to be used in scenarios where a model file is required for further processing. If neither a command line argument nor a valid environment variable is available, the function will print a warning message and terminate the program. This function should be called at the beginning of a program to ensure that a model file path is available for subsequent operations.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command line arguments passed to the program. It should be greater than or equal to 1, as the first argument is always the program name.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command line arguments. The second element (argv[1]) is expected to be the model file path if argc is greater than 1. The caller retains ownership of this array.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to a string containing the model file path. If no valid path is found, the function exits the program.
