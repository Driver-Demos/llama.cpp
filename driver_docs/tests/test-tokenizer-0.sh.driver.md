# Purpose
This Bash script, `test-tokenizer-0.sh`, is designed to automate the testing of a tokenizer's functionality by comparing the outputs of two different tokenization implementations: one in Python and the other in C++. It provides narrow functionality, specifically for testing and validating the consistency of tokenization processes across different programming languages. The script takes two command-line arguments: a tokenizer name and an input file. It compiles a C++ test executable, runs both the Python and C++ tokenizers on the input, and logs their outputs. The script then compares the tokenized outputs to ensure they match, indicating correct tokenization, and reports any discrepancies. This script is likely part of a larger testing suite for a software project involving natural language processing or machine learning models.
