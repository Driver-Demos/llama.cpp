# Purpose
This C++ code provides a narrow functionality, specifically designed to retrieve a model file path from either command-line arguments or an environment variable. It is part of a larger codebase, likely intended to be imported and used elsewhere, as suggested by the inclusion of a custom header file "get-model.h". The function [`get_model_or_exit`](#get_model_or_exit) checks if a model path is provided as a command-line argument; if not, it attempts to retrieve it from the environment variable `LLAMACPP_TEST_MODELFILE`. If neither source provides a valid path, it issues a warning and exits the program gracefully. This code is likely used in a testing context where a model file is required, and it ensures that the test is skipped if the file is not available.

# Functions

### get\_model\_or\_exit<!-- {{#callable:get_model_or_exit}} -->
The function `get_model_or_exit` retrieves a model file path from command-line arguments or an environment variable, and exits if neither is provided.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of character pointers listing all the arguments passed to the program.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the number of command-line arguments (`argc`) is greater than 1.
    - If true, set `model_path` to the second command-line argument (`argv[1]`).
    - If false, attempt to retrieve the model path from the environment variable `LLAMACPP_TEST_MODELFILE`.
    - Check if the retrieved environment variable is null or an empty string.
    - If the environment variable is null or empty, print a warning message and exit the program with a success status.
    - Return the `model_path`.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to a character string representing the model file path.
