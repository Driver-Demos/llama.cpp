# Purpose
This is a minimal C source file that serves as a basic template for a program, primarily focused on including necessary headers and setting up a conditional compilation environment. The file includes a header file named "llama.h," which likely contains declarations or definitions related to the program's core functionality. Additionally, it conditionally includes "ggml-kompute.h" if the preprocessor directive `GGML_USE_KOMPUTE` is defined, suggesting optional functionality or optimizations related to the Kompute library. The [`main`](#main) function is defined but empty, indicating that this file is a starting point for further development rather than a complete application.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `llama.h`
- `ggml-kompute.h`


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function serves as the entry point for the program but currently does not perform any operations.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function `main` is defined with a return type of `int` and takes no parameters.
    - The function body is empty, indicating no operations or logic are executed when the program runs.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value, which is typically used to indicate the program's exit status, but since the body is empty, it implicitly returns 0.
