# Purpose
The file is a `.gitignore` configuration file used in a Git repository. It specifies patterns for files and directories that should be ignored by Git. The asterisk `*` indicates that all files should be ignored, `!*. *` negates this for files with extensions, `*.o` specifically ignores object files, and `ggml-common.h` is explicitly included in the repository.
