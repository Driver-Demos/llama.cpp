# Purpose
This C++ source code file is an executable program designed to demonstrate multithreading and logging functionality. The main purpose of the code is to create and manage multiple threads, each of which generates a series of log messages. The program initializes an array of threads, each executing a lambda function that simulates logging activity by generating 1000 log messages. These messages are randomly categorized into four types: informational, warning, error, and debug, using the macros `LOG_INF`, `LOG_WRN`, `LOG_ERR`, and `LOG_DBG`, respectively. The logging behavior is further randomized by occasionally altering the log settings, such as timestamps and prefixes, using the functions `common_log_set_timestamps` and `common_log_set_prefix`.

The code provides a narrow functionality focused on multithreaded logging simulation. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces, as it is a standalone executable rather than a library or header file intended for reuse. The inclusion of "log.h" suggests that the logging macros and functions are defined elsewhere, likely in a separate logging library or module. The program's structure emphasizes concurrent execution and logging, showcasing how multiple threads can operate independently while sharing common logging resources. This example is useful for understanding thread management and logging in a concurrent environment.

# Functions

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function creates and manages multiple threads to simulate logging messages with varying log levels and occasionally modifies logging settings.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a constant `n_thread` to 8, representing the number of threads to be created.
    - Declare an array `threads` of `std::thread` with size `n_thread`.
    - Iterate over the range from 0 to `n_thread` to create and assign a new thread to each element in the `threads` array.
    - Each thread executes a lambda function that logs 1000 messages with a randomly chosen log level (INFO, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG).
    - Within the lambda, for each message, a random number determines the log type, and a switch statement logs the message accordingly.
    - Occasionally, based on a random condition, the logging settings are modified by toggling timestamps and prefixes using [`common_log_set_timestamps`](../common/log.cpp.driver.md#common_log_set_timestamps) and [`common_log_set_prefix`](../common/log.cpp.driver.md#common_log_set_prefix).
    - After all threads are created, iterate over the `threads` array to join each thread, ensuring all threads complete before the program exits.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer `0`, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`common_log_set_timestamps`](../common/log.cpp.driver.md#common_log_set_timestamps)
    - [`common_log_main`](../common/log.cpp.driver.md#common_log_main)
    - [`common_log_set_prefix`](../common/log.cpp.driver.md#common_log_set_prefix)
