# Purpose
This C++ source code file is a test program designed to validate the functionality of a grammar parsing system, specifically using the "llama" grammar library. The code is structured to initialize a grammar parser, define expected grammar rules and symbols, and then verify that the parser correctly interprets these rules. The program begins by setting up a `llama_grammar_parser` object and populating it with a set of predefined grammar symbols and rules. These rules are represented as vectors of `llama_grammar_element` objects, which define the structure and relationships between different grammar components, such as expressions, identifiers, numbers, and whitespace.

The main function of the program is to ensure that the grammar parser behaves as expected by comparing the parsed grammar stacks and candidate rejections against predefined expected values. It uses assertions to verify that the actual parsed elements match the expected elements, providing detailed error messages if discrepancies are found. Additionally, the program dynamically allocates memory for candidate code points and ensures proper cleanup by deleting these allocations before the program terminates. This test program is crucial for ensuring the reliability and correctness of the grammar parsing implementation, serving as a validation tool for developers working with the "llama" grammar library.

# Functions

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a grammar parser, sets up expected grammar rules and symbol IDs, validates grammar stacks against expected values, and manages memory for dynamically allocated resources.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a `llama_grammar_parser` object named `parsed_grammar`.
    - Define a vector `expected` containing pairs of grammar symbol names and their corresponding IDs.
    - Define a vector `expected_rules` containing vectors of `llama_grammar_element` representing grammar rules.
    - Populate `parsed_grammar.symbol_ids` with entries from `expected`.
    - Populate `parsed_grammar.rules` with entries from `expected_rules`.
    - Convert `parsed_grammar.rules` to a vector of pointers `grammar_rules`.
    - Initialize a `llama_grammar` object using `llama_grammar_init_impl` with `grammar_rules` and the root symbol ID.
    - Check if `grammar` is initialized successfully, throwing a runtime error if not.
    - Define `expected_stacks` containing expected grammar stacks for validation.
    - Iterate over grammar stacks obtained from `llama_grammar_get_stacks`, comparing each stack to `expected_stacks` and asserting equality.
    - Initialize a vector `next_candidates` with 24 `llama_grammar_candidate` objects, each with dynamically allocated `code_points`.
    - Define `expected_reject` containing expected reject candidates for each stack.
    - Iterate over grammar stacks, obtaining reject candidates using `llama_grammar_reject_candidates_for_stack` and comparing them to `expected_reject`, asserting equality.
    - Deallocate memory for `code_points` in `next_candidates`.
    - Free the `grammar` object using `llama_grammar_free_impl`.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
