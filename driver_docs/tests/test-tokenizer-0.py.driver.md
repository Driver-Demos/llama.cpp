# Purpose
This Python script is designed to tokenize a text file using a pre-trained tokenizer from the Hugging Face Transformers library. It is a command-line utility that requires two arguments: the directory containing the tokenizer model and the path to the text file that needs to be tokenized. The script utilizes the `argparse` module to handle command-line arguments, ensuring that the necessary inputs are provided by the user. The core functionality revolves around loading a tokenizer model from the specified directory and applying it to the contents of the given text file. The tokenization process is timed, and the resulting tokens are written to a new file with a `.tok` extension.

The script is structured to perform a specific task rather than serving as a library or module for broader use. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces, focusing instead on processing a single text file per execution. The script reads the entire content of the input file, tokenizes it, and writes the token IDs to an output file. Although there are commented-out sections that suggest additional processing or debugging steps, the primary output is a list of token IDs. The script also provides feedback on the tokenization process, including the time taken and the number of tokens generated, which can be useful for performance monitoring and verification.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `time`
- `argparse`
- `transformers.AutoTokenizer`


# Global Variables

---
### parser
- **Type**: `argparse.ArgumentParser`
- **Description**: The `parser` variable is an instance of `argparse.ArgumentParser`, which is used to handle command-line arguments for the script. It is configured to accept a positional argument `dir_tokenizer` and a required optional argument `--fname-tok`. The `dir_tokenizer` argument specifies the directory containing the 'tokenizer.model' file, while `--fname-tok` specifies the path to a text file that needs to be tokenized.
- **Use**: This variable is used to parse command-line arguments, enabling the script to receive input parameters for processing.


---
### args
- **Type**: `argparse.Namespace`
- **Description**: The `args` variable is an instance of `argparse.Namespace` that holds the parsed command-line arguments. It contains attributes corresponding to the command-line options defined in the `ArgumentParser`, specifically `dir_tokenizer` and `fname_tok`. These attributes store the values provided by the user when the script is executed.
- **Use**: This variable is used to access the command-line arguments throughout the script, allowing the program to dynamically use the specified tokenizer directory and file to tokenize.


---
### dir\_tokenizer
- **Type**: `str`
- **Description**: The `dir_tokenizer` variable is a string that holds the directory path to the tokenizer model file, which is specified by the user as a command-line argument. This directory is expected to contain the 'tokenizer.model' file necessary for initializing the tokenizer.
- **Use**: This variable is used to load the tokenizer model from the specified directory using the `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained` method.


---
### fname\_tok
- **Type**: `str`
- **Description**: The variable `fname_tok` is a string that holds the path to a text file specified by the user through a command-line argument. This path is required for the program to know which file to tokenize.
- **Use**: This variable is used to open the specified text file for reading and tokenizing its contents.


---
### tokenizer
- **Type**: `AutoTokenizer`
- **Description**: The `tokenizer` variable is an instance of the `AutoTokenizer` class from the Hugging Face Transformers library. It is initialized using a pre-trained tokenizer model located in the directory specified by `dir_tokenizer`. This tokenizer is responsible for converting text into token IDs, which are numerical representations used in natural language processing tasks.
- **Use**: The `tokenizer` is used to encode text from a file into token IDs, which are then written to an output file.


---
### fname\_out
- **Type**: `str`
- **Description**: The variable `fname_out` is a string that represents the output file name for the tokenized text. It is constructed by appending the extension '.tok' to the input file name `fname_tok`. This variable is used to specify the file path where the tokenized results will be saved.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define the output file path for writing the tokenized text results.
