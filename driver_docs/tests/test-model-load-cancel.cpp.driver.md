# Purpose
This C++ code is an executable program, as indicated by the presence of the [`main`](#main) function, which serves as the entry point for execution. The code provides narrow functionality, specifically designed to load a machine learning model from a file path provided as a command-line argument. It utilizes functions from the included headers "llama.h" and "get-model.h" to initialize a backend, configure model parameters, and load the model. The program checks if the model file exists and reports success or failure based on whether the model is successfully loaded. The use of a progress callback function suggests that the model loading process might involve significant computation or time, and the program is structured to handle this gracefully.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `llama.h`
- `get-model.h`
- `cstdlib`


# Functions

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a model loading process, checks for the model file's existence, and attempts to load the model with specific parameters, returning success or failure based on the outcome.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of C-style strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the model path using [`get_model_or_exit`](get-model.cpp.driver.md#get_model_or_exit), which exits if the model path is not provided.
    - Attempt to open the model file at the retrieved path; if unsuccessful, print an error message and return `EXIT_FAILURE`.
    - Print a message indicating the model file being used and close the file.
    - Initialize the llama backend using `llama_backend_init()`.
    - Set up `llama_model_params` with `use_mmap` set to false and a progress callback that returns true if progress exceeds 50%.
    - Attempt to load the model from the file using `llama_model_load_from_file` with the specified parameters.
    - Free the llama backend resources using `llama_backend_free()`.
    - Return `EXIT_SUCCESS` if the model is loaded successfully, otherwise return `EXIT_FAILURE`.
- **Output**: The function returns `EXIT_SUCCESS` if the model is loaded successfully, otherwise it returns `EXIT_FAILURE`.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`get_model_or_exit`](get-model.cpp.driver.md#get_model_or_exit)
    - [`llama_backend_init`](../src/llama.cpp.driver.md#llama_backend_init)
    - [`llama_backend_free`](../src/llama.cpp.driver.md#llama_backend_free)
