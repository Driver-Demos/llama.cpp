## Files
- **[CMakeLists.txt](vdot/CMakeLists.txt.driver.md)**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file in `llama.cpp/pocs/vdot` configures the build process for the `llama-vdot` and `llama-q8dot` executables, specifying source files, libraries, and C++ standard requirements.
- **[q8dot.cpp](vdot/q8dot.cpp.driver.md)**: The `q8dot.cpp` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase implements a performance comparison between simple and ggml-based dot product calculations using quantized data blocks.
- **[vdot.cpp](vdot/vdot.cpp.driver.md)**: The `vdot.cpp` file in the `llama.cpp` codebase implements and benchmarks various methods for computing dot products between quantized and floating-point vectors, including scalar and vectorized approaches.
