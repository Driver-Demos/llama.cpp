# Purpose
This CMake configuration file specifies build dependencies and includes directories for a project. It checks for the presence of the Threads package, which is required, and conditionally adds a subdirectory for the 'vdot' component if the 'GGML_BACKEND_DL' option is not set and the 'EMSCRIPTEN' environment is not active.
