# Purpose
This C++ source code file is designed to perform and benchmark dot product calculations between quantized and floating-point vectors. It includes functionality for generating random Gaussian-distributed floating-point numbers, quantizing these numbers into different formats, and computing dot products using both exact and quantized representations. The code leverages the GGML library for quantization and vector operations, which is evident from the inclusion of `ggml.h` and `ggml-cpu.h`. The file defines several structures (`block_q4_0`, `block_q4_1`, and `block_q8_0`) to represent quantized data blocks, and it provides functions to perform dot products on these quantized data types. The main function orchestrates the process by generating random data, performing quantization, and measuring the performance of dot product calculations using both scalar and vectorized approaches.

The code is structured to facilitate performance testing and comparison of different quantization methods and dot product implementations. It includes two main dot product functions, [`dot`](#dot) and [`dot3`](#dot3), which are optimized for different architectures, and a third function, [`dot41`](#dot41), for a different quantization scheme. The main function allows for command-line configuration of the number of iterations, the use of scalar or vectorized operations, and the choice of quantization method. The results, including the exact and quantized dot product values and their computation times, are printed to the console. This file is intended to be compiled and executed as a standalone program, as indicated by the presence of the [`main`](#main) function, and it does not define any public APIs or external interfaces for use in other programs.

# Global Variables

---
### kVecSize
- **Type**: `int`
- **Description**: `kVecSize` is a global constant integer variable defined using the `constexpr` keyword, which means its value is determined at compile time. It is set to `1 << 18`, which is equivalent to 2 raised to the power of 18, resulting in a value of 262144.

# Data Structures

### block\_q4\_0<!-- {{#data_structure:block_q4_0}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `d`: A float representing the delta value.
    - `qs`: An array of uint8_t representing nibbles or quantized values, with a size of QK4_0 / 2.
- **Description**: The `block_q4_0` struct is a data structure used for quantization purposes, specifically designed to store a delta value and an array of quantized values in the form of nibbles. The struct is optimized for size, ensuring that its total size is equal to the size of a float plus half of QK4_0, which is a predefined constant. This struct is likely used in operations involving quantized data, such as efficient storage or computation of dot products with quantized vectors.


---
### block\_q4\_1<!-- {{#data_structure:block_q4_1}} -->

    - `qs`: An array of uint8_t used for storing nibbles or quantized values.
- **Description**: The `block_q4_1` struct is a data structure designed to store quantized data, specifically for use in quantization processes. It contains two float members, `d` and `m`, which represent delta and minimum values respectively, and an array of `uint8_t` called `qs` that holds quantized values in the form of nibbles. This struct is used in operations that require quantization, such as dot product calculations, and is designed to ensure efficient storage and processing of quantized data.


---
### block\_q8\_0<!-- {{#data_structure:block_q8_0}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:

- **Description**: The `block_q8_0` struct is a data structure used to represent a block of quantized data, where `d` is a scaling factor (delta) and `qs` is an array of quantized values of type int8_t. This struct is designed to facilitate efficient storage and computation of quantized data, particularly in the context of vector operations, as indicated by its use in functions like `dot_q4_q8`. The static assertion ensures that the size of the struct matches the expected size, which is the sum of the size of a float and the size of the quantized array.
