# Purpose
This CMake configuration file defines the build instructions for two executable targets, `llama-vdot` and `llama-q8dot`. It specifies the source files `vdot.cpp` and `q8dot.cpp` for each target, links them with the libraries `common`, `llama`, and thread libraries, and enforces the use of C++17 standard features during compilation.
